I loved this week’s film, “Being the Change”, I loved seeing the happy family live a simple, sustainable life with the climate crisis in mind. I applaud this lifestyle because he and his family emit only 1/10th of what the average American emits. The combination of science and spirituality is resounding and very appealing. However, one thing rang in my head throughout the film, “Of course they can live this lifestyle, they are obviously very educated and comfortably Middle Class.” I couldn’t help but think how great it would be to only travel by bike but how can my mother carry all her house cleaning supplies on a bike? How can my father carry all his tile pasting, cement and floor buffers on a bike? My parents are not educated and do not have the choice to get better jobs. They are just trying to survive and help my sister and I hopefully thrive one day. More than anything I would love to also emit 1/10th of what the average American emits but it will be very difficult to change my family’s financial position. Of course I will continue to practice freeganism, consume less stuff, take trains instead of planes and live in smaller spaces however it irks me that relatively wealthy Americans point at impoverished families who have many children and drive large SUVs. How about they look at their own lives and see that their McMansion and wasteful habits are even more detrimental to the planet. I still appreciate this film because it encouraged its viewers and gave me a sense of hope. No matter how small a lifestyle change is, it will have a profound impact on the planet and society as a whole.

I really agree with what you said here.  It is nice to see positive ways in which a family can create a sustainable lifestyle.  But I do not see how it is attainable for most people.  Peter Kalmus is doing a great service for the public by showing us what is possible.  But many of us do not have the money or education to make the same transitions he has (I would be lost at how to convert me car into a grease engine).  It all seems to come down to needing to acquire a lot of capital in order to reduce the amount of capital you need to acquire in the future.  Though this may not seem problematic, it seems to me as if people will be constantly earning or buying more than they need before they are able to cut back.  I am not sure what the solution is, but I do not believe 'being the change' is a viable option for most people.

While watching the film I was thinking the same thing as you said, the family looks like they live a very fulfilling life also being sustainable. The family, to me, seemed to be in their own world amongst others like them in their own little community living happily. The lifestyle changes they made seemed simple and easy like riding their bike everywhere or growing their own produce and giving out food for free to their neighbors. It really gave hope to me because the father mentions even having this mentality and making the small changes to your lifestyle will eventually go a long way but with time. It amazed me when he said it took four years for him to reduce his emissions by more than a factor of 10 of what they were before because that seems so long. However, the lifestyle they live now makes up for it tremendously. I still couldn't help thinking of all the what ifs. Like you mentioned I immediately thought of my own family and how this lifestyle would be very difficult for them. My parents have had to travel long distances sometimes to be able to pay the bills and allow me to go here. Additionally, my closest friends' family has to clean multiple places that are scattered around town which would make things like riding a bike just unreasonable.Nonetheless, there are many choices they can make besides using a bike that my family can definitely do. Like the film mentions all it takes is more people becoming on board with sustainability to see mass change.

I found your comment very thoughtful in that it points out how becoming more environmentally friendly will be much more difficult for some than for others.  I think it is therefore very important as we transition to a more environmentally friendly culture, we are not discriminating against those who are unable to.  Rather than comparing one's carbon footprint to another, it is important to keep sustainability as a personal goal and to achieve the most of what people are comfortable with.  A cultural shift will not come over night, and some will change much more than others.  It is also much easier to achieve being more environmentally friendly if given an optimistic outlook by limiting your judgement to personal improvements.  Some people on average pollute / emit more greenhouse gasses than others, so their 50% decrease in carbon emissions will mean a lot more than the 50% decrease in carbon emissions for someone that didn't pollute as much in the first place.  Instead of the individuals comparing how the former person still pollutes more than the ladder, or the ladder had less of a net improvement than the former, comparing their personal achievements: 50%: they are both on good terms and should be optimistic of their achievements.

Your comment about your parents hit me hard: my dad has no choice but to have cases either sent out by plane or by car (it's bad, I know, but I unfortunately cannot think of a less environmentally destructive way to go about delivering crowns and dentures as quickly as possible to people who need them), however makes up for it by leaving essentially no waste when eating and favoring a heavily plant-based diet. Knowing this, I can only imagine that living the kind of life that Ken suggests might be borderline impossible for people living at or below the poverty line. There are definitely many people who can, however, and I strongly believe that people who have the liberty of choosing to make the shift toward climate friendliness definitely should, for the sake of both the people who cannot do so and the well being of the climate as a whole.

I totally fucking agree with you! I feel like these ideas are all great, but they don't really acknowledge the uneducated/working-class. My parents are both immigrants with a less than high school education,  my dad commutes to work at 3am to driving a truck for 10 hours and the last thing he would ever wanna do is get on a bike and bike home. We do not have a backyard to grow vegetables or recycle poop, we are surviving. My only wish is that one day I can give my family that lifestyle and we can begin to adopt some of these ideas into our daily lives. Living a simple and easy life is the dream I want to give. From the film I like that people were helping people, growing vegetables and giving them out. My father works delivering produce and when the produce does not meet the standard they will toss it, my dad takes some of the tossed produce home and distributes it with family and neighbors, because often times the produce is not very bad. Maybe a dent or a hole, not soft/hard enough.  So, we distribute it and it makes you happy to give.

I totally agree with your opinion. It is interesting to see that the man changed his viewing toward climate crisis after having babies. The film is really encouraging though ignoring a lot of difficulties with handling the real situation. One or two people change their lifestyle definitely will not be enough, actually far from enough to solve the problem we are facing right now. But still, it is great to think how we can change the world by gradually changing our own habits. A drop of water might seem to be ignorable and tiny, but thousands and millions of drops composite river and ocean. This film gave audience a sense of hope, and hopefully we all will try to make change after watching it and thus creating a profound impact on the planet and society as a whole as you mentioned.

This week's film was very interesting and very enjoyable.  The fact that he did not exactly know the effects of climate change until after he had his child is very interesting and very common.  Many people do not know the effects and dangers the climate crisis brings to not only us but to future generations.  I myself did not know how dangerous and how much certain things such as the consumption of meat, shopping at stores such as H&M, shopping online, traveling by automobile etc.  Before taking this class I knew about climate change, and the basic effects of it such as sea level rise and the ice caps melting.  Now that I am nearly about to finish the course, I now have so much knowledge about the effects of the climate crisis, and the dangers.  I really enjoyed seeing the family living a simple and sustainable life.  As well as with the knowledge and thoughts of the climate crisis.  This family shows that it is very possible to live a happy and simple life while having the climate crisis in mind and not contributing to it.  The lifestyle they were living was very efficient and amazing for the environment.  They were only emitting 1/10th of what the average American emits, this fact is amazing and very impressive.  At the beginning of the film it was said that he knew that climate change existed, but he did not know and did not think much of it, until he had his son.  After that he realized that he had to change the way he lived his life.  This goes to show, how possible it is to change your lifestyle, to change the way you live your life.  Not only for yourself, not only for your family, but for the future generations, for our home, the place we live on, Earth.

Your comment on this week’s film was so profoundly personal and utterly true because it points out the systemic  disparity of wealth that America needs to address when transitioning to an environmentally sustainable lifestyle. We cannot even begin to consider this change without understanding the inequalities enabled by a competitive, capitalist mentality that is promoted in almost every aspect of our own society. I like how you recognized that the financial stability that is necessary to achieve the lifestyle that Peter Kalmus and his family maintains is not a simple choice for many of us; it might well be a matter of sacrificing the only money that will put food on your table. For this reason, we ultimately need the radical social change that Ken has been advocating for during our class.

I'm sorry Ken, but what part of Thomas's life was "normal suburban life?" These were not practical lifestyle choices. This film felt culty and outdated. I hate to sound this critical because I truly enjoyed a good chunk of this film, but meditation, composting, and driving cars fueled by old vegetable oil is not something people can easily fit into their lives. Especially with small home/ apartment living with little to no yard to have a garden to grow self-sustainable food or compost in. Not everyone is an engineer who can take apart cars and build them back up again. Any car skills in men are hard to find as it is since home economics is no longer a life skill course for high schoolers. 

<br><br>
The part of the film that I did agree with was the whole aspect of reducing your waste and salvaging supermarket "food waste" that otherwise would have ended up in a landfill, contributing to global methane emissions. Watching supermarkets throw out perfectly good eggs in a container with one bad egg made my heart hurt. It made me think of the growing company called "Imperfect produce" in which farmers sell and deliver their "imperfect" looking crops to consumers for a reduced price. A simple blemish like a knot or a bruise means supermarkets won't want it displayed on their shelves. Instead of completely throwing it away, farmers can sell to a more accepting group of consumers who are eco-conscious and don't mind a morphed apple. 
<br><br>


I also agreed with some statements made at the end about the carbon tax where those emitting the most pollutants are burdened with a tax. This reverses the process of making yourself richer and leaving the poorer to clean up the mess. Fee puts a burden on people emitting the most.

I know your concern that it is really hard to change a family’s living style completely. Like I can’t become vegan by giving up eating meat immediately. When I took this class, I shared what I learned with my family, and hoped they could do something to help the environment. But most of the time, my family just can’t. They absolutely know how bad they are doing, and they do want to help the Earth, but it takes time. I have told them many impacts of eating beef, milk. What they can do right now is just to eat less meat, less milk, and buy less product, and no wasting. Nothing is done by one step. I like one sentence in the film, Peter said “doing stuff instead of talking about things, thinking about things, or reading about things”. We should have action right now. It doesn’t need to be a big change, and you don’t need to do the same thing as others. You need to follow your steps, and every step is for a better environment.

I honestly think that lifestyle in "Being the Change" is wonderful, I will do everything in my power to do have a similar eco-friendly lifestyle like his. However, I agree this lifestyle is hard for those below the stable middle class, just like myself and my mother. I am willing to ride a bike instead of driving a car, I would rather be on a plant-based diet than my regular meat diet, I WANT to emit only 1/10th of what the average American emits too. But for my mother, it is not even an option if she wants to help me get through with college and have a successful life. She never received the kind of education, not like what I have here in the States. I agree that some of the most wealthy Americans should start looking at themselves and realize the hypocrisy of their lifestyle if they want to complain that the problem lies within the impoverished families. Obviously education is important, but we need to acknowledge the elephant in the room, and that is the materialistic lifestyle most Americans have. This film heavily proves that point, that you can be a comfortable family of 4 and have a minimalistic and non-earth threatening lifestyle. This is the perfect film to show people who doubt that this lifestyle can be executed with a family, because if this man can do it, so can you. No excuses here.

<br><hr>

I really resonated with your comment because I had extremely similar thoughts while watching the film. I enjoyed the film as well, and it made me happy to see what can be done. But when I thought about my own family and how practically impossible it would be to try and live that kind of environmentally friendly lifestyle, I realized it just wouldn’t work. We aren’t in a good financial situation. A lot of actions that could be taken to help combat climate change, such as switching to largely plant-based diets, choosing public transportation or bicycles instead of driving cars, or buying only eco-friendly clothing, amongst other great ways to help combat climate change, are all pretty much unfeasible for my family. Don’t get me wrong, I still applaud everyone who does take meaningful action in their personal lives and I think everyone should strive to do something even if it is small. It just is a downer to think about how many actions my family, and I’m sure many other families, are unfortunately unrealistic to carry out. 
<br><br>
Apart from the lifestyle promoted in the film, Peter himself really impressed me with the way he decided to personally contribute to saving the planet in reducing his carbon footprint. It was an inspiration to see and I think if everyone could have that same kind of conviction and consciousness, we’d be well on our way to saving the planet. Unfortunately, we are still in the process of spreading awareness and taking baby steps to combating this crisis, but little things like this film really do give me a bit more hope.




<br><hr>

I agree in that the specific approach that Peter takes in the film is one that is only plausible for a middle class family with the time, money, and education to make those changes. However, I think the point of the film (and of Ken assigning it to us) is to show one example of someone 'being the change' that they can be. While 1/10th of the average American's emissions is technically the expectation of the world population under the Paris Accords, I don't think that the list of actions that Peter takes to get to the 1/10th mark are the expectation for the American population. The message is to do what you are able. 
<br><br>

To address your example, if switching to biking is not plausible for your parent's situation, then maybe food waste is something your family can tackle. Maybe not eating as much meat. At the same time, however, I do understand that these changes are likely not on the priority list for many Americans, who have to survive themselves first before they can think about the planet's survival. That's where I agree with you in that those who have the resources to do so should take the lead in 'being the change' in lowering their carbon footprint. Americans should not point to impoverished families to have less children or change their behaviors when a wealthy American's lifestyle tends to be much more detrimental and is easier to change.

I think you made a really good point in this comment. It's great to see a family be able to live this lifestyle in a positive manner and have high spirits about life while having such a lessened carbon footprint, showing for universal benefit. But while this may work so peacefully for this one particular family, it definitely will not be as easy for others to partake in this solution in the same way. That's one problem with the solutions that people have come up with for the climate crisis; they are simply too generalized.  It is not reasonable to assume that everyone at all status levels can completely forego their normal transportation and ride a bike everywhere. People on this earth are much too different to be able to conform to some of these solutions. I think that it definitely should be attempted to the best of everyone's ability but I also think that a further investigation after an initial stage of change will be needed in order to accommodate everyone's lifestyle or else they simply won't change because they won't think they can. 
<br><br>
One thing I can think of is to have representatives or films like this for all different class levels showing the steps each one can take that may fit better with their needs. Like you said, it is not fair to blame lower classes for some actions that may not be the best for the world but in the world we live in, are the only options for them. This is why solutions need to happen at higher levels of society that will feed down into the people who support large companies in order to stay alive.

I really enjoy this movie because its logic is clear by introducing problems with chapters and different places. At first of the movie, it is introduced by a group of people who always focus on serious environmental problem. In the first chapter, they interview different people that relate to urban agriculture instead of rural agriculture to indicate the efficiency of urban agriculture and why there are such amount of industrial agriculture. 

 <br><br>


Tomorrow is not only a movie for the people who study or worried about environment problem, but also for the people like me who have not noticed how serious the problem is. In this way, the movie can encourage more and more people to learn about earth problem which would form stronger power to protect ourselves and the whole world. 

 
<br><br>

Also, what attract me in this movie is that it gives me hope instead of fear of the future. For example, by describing the micro-farming, it demonstrates the convenience of it because it can improve people’s environment and produce enough food for people instead of overwhelming output.

I really like your comment in which you describe that we are not all able to live a small carbon footprint lifestyle. Like yeah, we would all like to try and do our part to help reduce our emissions but there are things that we can’t do. We’ve been hearing a lot about using bikes, buses, and trains in order to get to work. Well we don’t all have jobs where we just need to take ourselves. Some people need to take equipment for work and it would be difficult to have on a bike and you wouldn’t want to be carrying everything on a bus/train. And now we don’t all have the knowledge to make our vehicles run on vegetable oil. Not all of us have a backyard in which we can grow our own food, making humanure toilets completely useless to us. This is a good film in which it shows how Peter was able to cut down on his carbon emissions, but it would not be possible for us to follow his lead by taking the same actions he has. This works for him and only him, we need to figure out changes that everyone can make in order to cut down our emissions to 1/10th like Peter has.

Watching the film “Being the Change,” I found it unbelievable that this family was able to lower its carbon footprint. It is an amazing thing to do for the environment, but I agree with you that this is easy to do for a middle class family in America. Some people are struggling to even make ends meet, how can they put so much of their energy into the climate crisis? The things this family and others have sacrificed to live more environmentally friendly inspires many people, but we should know to not judge someone that can’t always make environmentally sound decisions in order to make a living. 
<br><br>
	Besides what I mentioned, I think it is phenomenal that this family has a carbon footprint 1/10th of the average American family. I hope that those who are capable of implementing some of these things in their life try to do so. One thing I probably wouldn’t do though, is meditate. I’ve personally never seen what benefits I could possibly gain from it nor have I ever wanted to try it. 
<br><br>
	The things that this family did astounded me. They tried to bike as much as they could, they created an outdoor restroom, and started a huge garden in their backyard. They were doing so much and were trying to live more sustainably. The movie was very interesting and made me realize that you have to be at peace with your life and be content with the simple things in life.

I completely agree with you in that it was lovely to see a family be truly happy living a “simple and sustainable life” where it didn’t appear that they had to make any huge, unrealistic sacrifices. As Ken suggested, living in this manner may even be better than living an ordinary American life - a far cry from a bland life of deprivation. However, you are also right in pointing out how living in this manner also requires sacrifices, not all of which can be reasonably made, for example, expecting someone to carry everything on a bike. But if we approach this with the same perspective that we approached diets in the previous video (where Ken talked about being a climatarian), we can at least work on reducing our carbon footprint by making less trips to the store, and using less unnecessary products in the first place. I appreciate your honesty in describing your personal situation and your parent’s necessity to hold certain jobs to give you and your sister the best opportunity possible. I think it perfectly draws attention to the issues of climate justice that come with fighting climate change - we have to have realistic expectations. I truly admire you taking personal action and making it your goal to practice freeganism, and consume less, rather than blaming other Americans who have a bigger carbon footprint. It really is about us doing the best we can with what we have until we can do better. Like the video pointed out, not everybody has to go and make as radical of a lifestyle change as Peter did, but any positive change helps even if it’s just in a small way. 
<br><br>
Also, when I was watching the documentary I wondered how easy and effective it was to run a car on used vegetable oil? Would you have to drastically change the engine of a car to make it work long-term? And does it even make that big of a difference as far as emissions? If anyone knows, please let me know!



<br><hr>


your comment truly stuck with me because I am so surprised that I hadn't acknowledged transferring work materials when thinking about transforming into a biking society before. It is frustrating how people who contribute the most to climate change with excessively luxurious lifestyles-McMansions, private jet flights, and numerous sports cars- should be changing their ways and putting less pressure on people who actually need to depend on a car to survive.

<br><br>

My dad is a self-employed electrician who depends on a 1990's huge, gas-guzzling work van to transport his array of materials for projects. While from the enlightened student perspective, I find this environmentally destructive, I also understand he is making an environmental impact out of pure necessity. A lot of people in this country, placing emphasis on celebrities and the upper class, do not follow suit. In our consumerist culture, status is displayed through material belongings, accumulating junk that portrays the life you want others to accept. I wish in the future, status can be displayed through compassion for the planet.



<br><hr>

I have mixed feelings watching your comment. When we talking about and getting the education of climate crisis in Ken’s class, we mainly focus on the developed world and ignore the other developing parts, which involve families and countries. To make the issue of climate a world issue, we need international common view as well as an overall educated population. So that’s why education is one of the top 25 solutions in Project Drawdown. I’m glad that we all enjoy the video “Being the Change.” Acknowledging the truth, at the same time, we need to be optimistic. For the developing parts, there are definitely targeted solutions and alternative climate-friendly approaches. If they couldn’t copy and paste the entire lifestyle Peter Kalmus’s family does in the film, they could do at least some of the protecting manner with the belief in mind. Belief is the core. There will be a day that all other parts catch up and do what Americans are able to do now.




<br><hr>
I think you make a very valid point about accessibility to knowledge, resources and time. Peter knows how to make efficient changes to his family’s lifestyle, Peter has access to the necessary resources (like parts for his car, a backyard for composting, etc), and Peter has the time to make such changes/repairs to his car or build a backyard bathroom/composting system or time to salvage food. There is a bigger system in play that is pushing capitalism in opposition to individual, pro-climate change. For example, my dad works two full time jobs and there is no way he would consider taking public transportation because he would not make it to both jobs in time. The film says that individual action is just as important as collective action. However, I pose the question of whether the people who are positioned to be able to make more change should hold more responsibility to break down bigger systems that hold others from being able to make such changes? In other words, I feel some of us should overcompensate, if we are going to rely on individual change being enough, because individual change does not look the same for everyone, nor does it have the same effect on the climate for everyone. Another example, Kanye using a private jet 50% less than he already does is going to have a bigger impact than me carpooling 50% of the time I drive to LA. In this consideration, I would say collective action is more effective.





<br><hr>

It is so true that the family in the film are so well educated middle class that they have the ability to live with only one-tenth of the average American’s carbon footprint and travel by bike. With that being said, we cannot expect every American to be educated like them, live like them. People are all having their own way of living, and I think, what we should do is that based on what we are doing and our living style right now, we could have at least some improvement just to reduce our carbon footprint, like shifting to climatarian or freegan, something that is not really hard or people like us to do. To be honest, I really wish I could live the life the family in the film has, like… who doesn’t? If we all have the ability to do the same thing, I believe, at least half of the population is probably willing to do so. It might sound pessimistic, but with no help from others, form the society, I think it is kind of to lead to a turning point of this climate situation...


<br><hr>

I personally don’t think that the climate crisis will be significantly affected in a meaningful way by trying to change the attitudes of the American public in particular. Everyone is writing about how they like seeing the “positive” changes that this family is making to lower their impact when I doubt anyone would actually implement these practices in their life, let alone have them make a significant impact on any relevant scale. The whole “walk the walk” sentiment of this documentary is unproductive. Frankly people have to be governed into doing anything beneficial on this matter for it to create a relevantly sized impact. Carbon pricing, animal products taxes, etc, are what are going to influence on a societal and global scale as opposed to individual actions, which may decrease a single person or families emissions, but have very little influence or impact as they can be negated so easily. I think producing food more locally is important, I think being more energy independent is important, but these things will not be adopted by the general public and trying to shift public opinion significantly will result in little progress and be, relatively speaking, ineffective.




<br><hr>


I completely agree with you as well, and have commented similar sentiments in past videos. It is a simple fact of life that not everyone can afford to switch to a completely environmentally friendly lifestyle. It is a process that requires a large investment of money, time, and effort that so many people just cannot afford. I often find that hardcore environmentalist will often look down on these people who are simply trying to live paycheck to paycheck, while they themselves are privileged with a large enough income that they can make those lifestyle changes easily. If we really want to advance the climate change reversal agenda, we shouldn't be so harsh with our views on others who aren't 100% on board, and instead (as Jocelyn said) encourage to do what little they can, whether it be to make sure they are sorting trash and recycling, or using their car less, or trying to transition from eating more beef to more chicken. Although it may seem small, if we all were to collectively commit to these small changes, the impact would be absolutely enormous. From there, more and more small little steps will be taken among everyone until we have all finally reached the goal of zero emissions without alienating or leaving anyone behind. That is the goal.

I had a very similar reaction to the film that you did. Watching this family make the conscious decisions to lessen their carbon footprint was inspiring, and gave me a little bit of hope, something that is rare for me in this class. I also liked to see him take care of his mental health with an hour long meditation in the morning and at night. I don't have enough time for that, but I try to find time for meditation when I can. My thoughts about my parents were the same as yours. How can my dad get to a session 45 minutes away from his house? He can't bike, and it would take forever to take the bus there and back. Almost his whole day would be spent on the bus. My mom's work is about 15-20 minutes away by car, and she wears nice dress clothes to work. She would never bike in a million years. Another thing I noticed was the kids walking or biking to school. When I was growing up, school was roughly 20 minutes away by car, and we always got to school as it was starting, rarely early. It would've been near impossible to bike to school and make it on time. While this family is inspiring, and many more people need to start living the way these people are, it just is not doable for everyone. I'm not sure what those families could be doing when this lifestyle doesn't work for them.





<br><hr>
I totally agree with your statement about how the living conditions of the narrator permit him to lead this type of lifestyle. Others are not as lucky and have to adopt a quick-thinking no nonsense attitude towards life simply to stay alive or else they will not be able to keep up. This is definitely a privilege that addresses several larger systematic issues. Without these problems though, the narrator makes pertinent points about little ways to live our lives with purpose. His whole outlook upon life itself was very inspiring to me because I have never lived life from the viewpoint that he carries. Every second that we experience alive is a single moment trapped in time that should be celebrated and taken note of. We really take our time as granted in this incredibly fast paced society that is intent on getting from one location to the next with little regard for the steps in between, and I think that's something that needs to be changed for sure. 
<br><br>

Aside from that, Being the Change was an ambivalent watch for me. At first I thought the film had zero direction and was just randomly spouting random facts about this stranger and his family as well as other guest speakers with no clear relevance but slowly  I began to see exactly why Ken had assigned this film for us to watch. Peter is honestly a really inspiring man for having turned his life around 180 degrees like that for the sake of future generations including his children especially considering his living conditions. I cannot imagine living in such a busy city such as LA where life is so fast paced and dependent upon the nature of speed + efficience to completely disregard that way of living and just take time to slow down, enjoying the moment. The man drives a car powered  solely on recycled vegetable oil, for gods sake, with zero worry or panic about how far it will take him or whether it may stop at any time. I wish to be on that level of unbotheredness at some point in my life. Aside from that, the other lifestyle changes he had made such as the humanure for alternative composting really was eye opening to me because I had no idea that people out there were genuinely doing this and that it was working. His graphics about how much safer it was for the environment really sold me about the whole process, and while I wont go out of my way to make a humanure box smack dab in my apartment at UCSB I respect the idea and hope it becomes a more widespread idea in the future. I just really liked the way that this man turned his whole life around to support his beliefs, and hope that I get inspiration to do the same in any way I can.

I really enjoy what you said, from top to bottom. My family also would not be able to afford to ride around in bikes, there job being too far and it requires them to carry their own equipment as well. Seeing them struggle makes it hard to be content with living a simple, sustainable life as that happy family. I like how you pointed out they were well educated meaning they probably have wealth to back up on. It is really different having to live that way and making the choice to live that way. I think of the Minimalist documentary a lot and think about the privilege those guys have of living that lifestyle and how easy it is for them to advocate for it. I agree with you, I would love to emit 1/10th of what the average American emits but if changing my family's financial position and circumstance requires me to do otherwise, I would. But any small lifestyle change will surely be ten times better than making no change at all so like you, I too would continue to make the changes I can do willingly and with pleasure to help. This comment just makes me really think about all those who suffer in poverty and have a goal to come out of it and purchase all the big things they once couldn't. The way it is so detrimental to the planet but also the way I root for them to be able to do so.

I fail to see the connection between meditation and fighting climate change. It seems to me as though Kalmus is proposing only personal changes to fight climate change. He doesn’t talk about collective change. He uses the quote “be the change you wish to see in the world” and that makes sense. I guess he’s showing ways we can be the change while being happy. I’ve heard of the term “climate disorder” somewhere before. I think it was in a Heartland institute site/page/book. Where they attack alarmists. Oh, it was a psychologist or something concerned about his patients over concern about the climate attacking climate change. Kalmus accepts this and says that joining a community will help with feeling overwhelmed. I remember the beginning of English 23, when we were reading Wallace Wells and watched Fire in Paradise. I felt so pessimistic and hopeless and overwhelmed, I just wanted to distract myself. I remember the discussion on the issues of being too alarmist or negative. Mind, body, and relationships with the environment and others. They go hand in hand, as described by Kalmus in his “mind, hand, and heart” explanation. Another thing is his tattoo about “correct awareness,” which I found interesting. There can be incorrect awareness? I agree. Being aware of the facts and feeling overwhelmed, panicking. Maybe that’s incorrect awareness. Maybe incorrect awareness is also not acting on it. I really loved how nice and happy Kalmus was. I want to be as happy as the people he features in the movie, such as Pancho, who seems so calm and loving. I want a wholesome community where people fix things for free, like in the repair cafe. Wow, being good to the environment can be so fulfilling. I’d trade economic growth for that happiness any day. It was so cute when Kalmus showed his vegetable oil fueled car. He seemed so proud of it. More free time, more DIY. Plenitude economy. I can’t wait for these changes. Not just for the environment, but for me. I want to be happier. I also appreciate how welcoming Kalmus is, compared to Cowspiracy where “anyone who eats meat isn’t an environmentalist”. Kalmus is much more flexible. This reminds me of Ken’s lecture about how immediately labeling yourself as “vegan” will put people off and give off a “morally superior than you” vibe. By being the change, Kalmus gets other people to change. I think he’s a climate vanguard.

I completely agree with your comment. The efforts the family made to reduce their carbon footprint to one-tenth of the average American's carbon footprint is remarkable, however, people fail to account for the privilege of this family had before their change. Wealthy Americans tend to point to people other than themselves to make this change. This should not be the case when wealthy Americans have the most privilege and are in a better place to make this change. Unfortunately, low-income Americans simply cannot afford making this major change. I think wealthy Americans should lead the way in living a more sustainable life as they have the resources to accomplish this. In this film I like how they addressed the carbon tax and how they would return the fees from the carbon tax to households rather than the government. I also thought that it was important that the film addressed how the United States produces enough food to feed two U.S. populations, meanwhile 50 million Americans remain food insecure. Obviously, I think it is important that the public strives for sustainable living, but we need to understand the systematic oppression that low-income families face that restricts them from greatly reducing their carbon footprint.

I totally agree. It's a great thing to say that they emit so much less, yet they have so much more opportunity to make those decisions that let them emit less. In the end we can only do what we can do. doing the best we can do, voting, and spreading the message to others is the best thing to do. We don't all have to live a perfectly environmentally friendly life but trying is important no matter how small of a difference it makes.

I really agree with your point of view taken from this video. It is inspiring to see people live a sustainable life that can positively affect the earth in the long run or at least help somewhat with the climate crisis. Emitting only 1/10 of carbon emissions compared to the average American would be incredible but it can be extremely hard to do with huge families. Huge families have no choice, but to travel in a SUV and use more carbon emissions. It can definitely be a hard transition if they are just so used these things , but we must do so slowly in order to save our planet. Even a small daily lifestyle change can make a huge impact on the earth and help cut off the huge carbon emissions humans use.




<br><hr>


I also enjoyed this week’s film “Being the Change”. I think the lifestyle the family lived is extremely admirable because they choose to live in a way that is conscious of their carbon footprint and contribute actively towards mitigating the climate crisis. However, I also think you bring up an extremely relevant point. One’s socioeconomic status, the circumstances of their job and lifestyle, as well as where they are living can have a huge difference on how much one is able to limit their carbon footprint. For instance, those living in large cities can more realistically choose to use public transportation and avoid owning a car altogether compared to those living in the suburbs. Likewise, international students must take multiple flights a year simply to go back home and get to while so it’s not a simple matter of limiting the amount of vacations you choose to take. I strongly believe that a lot of the solutions to the climate crisis are at least related in part to living a more minimalistic and less materialistic life where we learn to prioritize different things besides large houses, owning luxury vehicles, and extreme consumerism. After all, all of these phenomenons arose not even a century ago and it is completely possible to live a fulfilling life even if you cut out all these things. I think a lot of the materialistic things associated with the American dream and what it means to be successful are actually superficial and not at all what’s important in life.



<br><hr>

What you said really resonated with me because similar thoughts have passed through my head as well. I think you pinpointed a significant reason why more people are not concerned about the climate crisis. They cannot afford to care. When poorer families struggle just to stay employed or find their next meal, they cannot afford to care about these larger more abstract problems such as the climate crisis. It saddens me because they shouldn’t have to be in that position in the first place, if it weren’t for corporations and the dramatic wealth inequality. In addition, wealthy people with their expendable money should be the ones working to solve the problem, not the ones that are the main contributors. It is unfair how the world is, and there are so many things working against us to solve the climate crisis.




<br><hr>

I could totally understand your points and I think your comment on the film is very thoughtful. Personally speaking, I am living a life that at least I do not have much to worry about. I do not have to worry about if I have enough money to buy food or clothes, as long as I am not expecting to buy luxuries. I am satisfied so far. And when I talk to my parents, they are willing to hear me out and try those practicable way of reducing green house gas emission. But I know there are so many people who are concerning about living situations. They got financial situations on their mind, how can they focus on the emission of carbon dioxide? I am not criticizing people being selfish on climate issues. I am saying that it is understandable that some people are not acting on this issue or they can never be. For those people who are in or beyond middle class, they do not have concerns about living, so they have the energy and time to exploring climate issues. But for most people who are struggling, climate issue is the not the focus on their lives, which makes sense as well.




<br><hr>

You make a very great point about how economic status can have a huge effect on a family's ability to reduce its climate footprint. Many people might not have the time or the ability to convert their car on vegetable oil, or frequently go around to different stores to see if they have any available waste to take. If someone's job requires them to haul equipment or drive long distances then they will not be able to bike to work. They might not have the time to convert their backyard into an eco-friendly area, or they might not have a backyard at all. I think the film does showcase some great ways for people to reduce their carbon footprint, and it is inspiring to see how much of a difference some of these individuals are making. But it is unrealistic for many families to go as far as the ones that are shown in the film do. I do think, however, that people can make small changes in their lives, such as reducing the amount of meat they consume, and that these small changes can mean a big difference for our planet.




<br><hr>

I understand your concern, and I think your comment is really insightful. When we are talking about switching to a sustainable lifestyle or the cultural change, it brings up a problem that some people are not able to do that due to financial or educational issue. As Ken stated previously, the developed countries need to “degrowth,” and others need to develop sustainably. I think it is the same for individuals. It is encouraged to do just a little as they can, like trying to consume turkey instead of beef. Even a small movement can make a huge difference collectively.




<br><hr>


I totally agree with your comment Jocelyn! When I watched the film, I found that film's focus on the family made it more relatable to the audience. Even though financially the family wasn't relatable to me, I found other aspects that were. When Peter was talking about how after he found out about the climate crisis and would spend his time freaking out about, it resonated with me. He admitted that he spent more time initially worrying about the issue instead of proactively doing something about it. I'm in the same position myself. There are many times where I will be consumed in my thoughts thinking about all the issues in the world but fail to actively make small changes in my life. Although climate change is a big issue, each small change counts. Despite this not being a new concept to me, it was nice to have it repeated in this film. Apart from that, I also agree that some of these things may be harder to adopt into our own routines. However, I think the main focus of the film was each person's journey is different in combating climate change and you have to find the best way that will fit into your lifestyle.



<br><hr>


I also loved seeing family live in an environmentally friendly lifestyle. Although this lifestyle might not suit every other family, it demonstrates that changes could be made to a positive outcome. Their changes were as simple as sharing foods and riding bikes. Personal lifestyle is the most fundamental and most crucial step to reduce global warming. We need people like Peter Kalmus to set up a good example. Some people don’t make changes because they never thought about it. We need to get people thinking about how to make changes at first. Encouraging them to believe that living green is possible. Everyone can be a hero of our planet.



<br><hr>
I really agree with your ideas! It is hard for a family to change lifestyle, especially for the old people who already kept their habits for many years. For example, my grandmother could never prefer carbs to vegetables, because she experienced famine in last century China. Compared with vegetables or fruits, carbs are hard to digest and keep people fulfilled for longer. But the good thing is that when I introduced this class to my parents, they are highly interested in this class, and they think my family should make some changes for the environment. Though it takes time for us to change some habits, as long as we have the ideas and concepts about nature and the environment, our behaviors will change potentially. Instead of eating much beef, our family prefer to eating fish now. My family is living in the city which is close to the sea, so we have various choices of local-planted food in daily diets. No matter how long it will take, we should start making changes right now.





<br><hr>
I think that you bring up an incredibly important point here.  Not only should we be concerned with climate injustice as it impacts other, third world countries, but how it affects the people in our own country as well.  Lower income families often aren't granted the option to live these low emission lifestyles, they are unrealistic, and at times even impossible.  In a perfect world, everyone would be able to live within these "green" conditions which we see this family living in throughout the film.  I think that it is important to remember however, that there are always exceptions to these changes that we find necessary.  We all can only do as much as we can.  Take vegetarianism for example, not everyone is able to commit to a strict vegan diet.  It could be for many different reasons.  For example, someone's medical status could require them to eat meat for protein reasons.  In this case, I would argue that they may be able to give up dairy or eggs.  The same goes for affordability.  Not everyone can afford to eat vegan or drive green, or use green electricity, and in these cases, I argue they are not accountable to.  I think that we all need to do what is realistic in our own lives, but be careful to not use little things as excuses for ourselves.

Hey I really appreciated your comment and sharing that part of your family with us. It's a struggle and aspect to the fight against climate change i feel like we haven't really discussed. It feels like alot of the solutions described appeal to a middle class that is slowly fading. Like yeah, I get that the 5% of the US population are high and mighty and don't care about humanity, but what about the lower class? What about the lower class that relies on this current economy and fossil fuel system just to (maybe) survive? Hopefully it's something we can cover more later on in this class. 
<br><br>
As for the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it as you did! Through the course, I have felt somewhat shaky on the individual power of people to make a difference in day to day changes (not like going around and preaching about minimalism or something like that.) Peter's experience with his family and interviewing other climate activists opened me up more to the idea that those little drops of climate activism do make a difference; the changes add up and can cause a ripple effect within your community. We as humans form a community and it's on us to start that drip ripple system. 
<br><br>

To me, it comes down to making that mental switch on our outlook on life; it's not about chasing that new car or fad, but it's about chasing happiness. To paraphrase one of the interviewees in the movie, in searching for how we can serve others, we can serve ourselves and find happiness.




<br><hr>


I also agree with you that seeing a happy family living a sustainable lifestyle was extremely refreshing. Throughout this entire course we are thrown into the detrimental future we will leave to upcoming generations. We are given solutions that we can adapt in our everyday lives and the consequences if we dont through the projections provided by scientific researchers. We face ourselves and question whether giving up our current habits is possible and if they will not only contribute to the betterment of our Earth, but also the wellness of our lives. Seeing this family that emits a tenth of what an average American would emit is extremely eye opening. It shows an actual example that seems reachable and creates an incentive to switch our detrimental habits to more sustainable alternatives. I also agree with you that this freedom of being able to make these sustainable alternatives comes with the financial stability one has. Most of my family works in construction and would not be able to bike. They do not have the choice of becoming sustainable and reaching this level of wellness while only emitting of what and average American emits. They are restricted by their financial responsibilities. This is why it is important ot emphasize that the people that are fortunate enough to participate in adapting their lifestyles should. We often do not realize that living "green" is a privilege.



<br><hr>


I agree with your concerns. We cannot expect impoverished families to severely limit their lifestyles because the middle class and upper class are not willing to make changes to their carbon intensive lifestyles. In many ways I find this situation similar to a macroscopic level concerning different countries. As professor Ken has said many times, countries like the USA point to countries like China and India that have large amounts of the population that is still impoverished and is trying to rapidly develop in order to provide a better standard of living for their inhabitants. Instead of trying to block their attempts at becoming more developed we should try to help them transition to an economy and energy system that is not carbon intensive while simultaneously doing so ourselves. I think we should also do this on a microscopic scale and help families within the United States



<br><hr>


I also had similar thoughts while watching the film. While I praise the filmmaker for his ability to live such a sustainable lifestyle, it is very difficult for people who do not have the financial means to make such adjustments to transition to this lifestyle. However, I believe that it is important for people in higher positions of privilege to recognize their access to such abilities and to do their part to help their community achieve sustainable goals. One part of the film I enjoyed was when several community members gathered together to provide free food for their neighbors. Although a small action, this act helps people who may not have the financial means to purchase food have access to food, while also reducing the GHG emissions related to transportation. Therefore, I believe there should be a bigger emphasis on making the climate change not only based on individual actions, but on actions that can help the community become more sustainable.



<br><hr>

The film, "Being the Change" has also left a lasting impact on me and it's making me consider completely switching over to a more sustainable life. I feel that people are not willingly to switch over because of what social media is providing it's audience. I feel that one of the best ways for people to make the switch to a more sustainable lifestyle is to see famous people lead the way. If famous people lead the way then others will follow and then the media will be focused on those efforts which will then make politicians want to do the same. Having 1/10th the amount of the average american's emissions is pretty impressive, however all I could really think about when watching the film was the "normal bob" from "spongebob" and how lame the guys life was to me.Although lame, he seemed very happy with his family and his living situation so I applaud him. Living this life can make some people happy, however it will definitely be opposed by many others especially those that aren't educated about the topic, are adrenaline junkies and are shopaholics because they're just so addicted to the stuff we have today. I was astonished to find out that we are able to provide food for two times the size of the United States population and that is why there is so much food waste. Instead of mass producing food we should be focusing on distribution and providing food for everyone instead. I also liked the idea about a carbon fee and dividend because only then will people want to switch over to renewables.



<br><hr>

I also thought it was pretty incredible to see the daily things that Peter was doing to reduce his family’s emissions down to 1/10th of what the average American emits. Watching him made me think about some of the possible living habit changes that I can make to my own life. In the future when I own my own home, I can try to take up some of the changes that he made in his home. The combination of science and spirituality with the emphasis on meditation was something that I was surprised to see as we have not really seen anything focused on spirituality in this class yet. I agree that they were definitely able to do this because they were comfortably middle class. A lot of the changes that Peter made and the loss of time doing some of the things his family does may not be possible adjustments for people that need to work long hours to barely survive. But for people that have comfortable living incomes, there are many adjustments that can easily be made. I can and will work on consuming less, finding a smaller place to live in the future, and finding more environmentally friendly modes of transportation. I feel like these are all relatively easy changes that I can make. All I need to do is let go of any attachments to material. While it may not seem like much when we change individually, it comes out to a lot when many people decide to also change their individual lifestyles.




<br><hr>
I hear your frustration, but I think it is necessary to have people like Peter Kalmus that show an example of what an utmost sustainable lifestyle looks like. Your opinion is valid, but I think, grassroots, independent documentaries like Kalmus’s “Being the Change” exists to give a glimpse of the “Head, Hands, and Heart,” Repair Cafe, and “The Food Waste Fiasco” philosophy and lifestyle because it is not in the mainstream. Personally, I would recommend after feeling the initial frustration, recognize that you are receiving an education and learning a lot from this class and from watching documentaries like this, and even if you feel that your parents have limitations, YOU can at least try to communicate to them the things that you have learned and help your family implement changes little by little, in the areas that you and your family feel comfortable. For example, the idea with the “Food Waste Fiasco” was to show the world how much perfectly good food was being thrown in the dumpster, to stop this food from being thrown in the dumpster in the first place, and find a way to distribute this food to people before it touched the dumpster. Try researching if there is a local food bank in your community where you can pick up free food (Ex: AS Food Bank!) and if not, and if you are truly passionate, what is stopping YOU from finding a way to get that food from your local grocery stores and restaurants and creating a place to distribute that perfectly good food to your family and community? I think it is integral to recognize and emphasize that Peter Kalmus did not create the documentary to make people feel bad by showing how eco-friendly him and his family are. The focus is on how it is not impossible to live these kinds of alternative lifestyles that may be out of our socialized American lifestyles’ comfort zones. 
<br><br>

In response to Ken’s question of whether this is the beginning of a movement, I definitely think so. It is truly interesting to be living in Isla Vista where I feel that a lot of these similar sustainable habits are practiced. We have the Isla Vista Trading Post and different pop-up thrift shops all the time in the community, we have the IV Compost Collective helping students incorporate composting into their daily lives, the AS Food Bank, UCSB Greenhouse and Garden Project where you can pay a fee to have your own area to garden and grow produce, the different Co-Op houses which have their own gardens in the backyard and practice sustainable habits, just to name a few! There is also a community of people called “Slabbers” living off-the-grid alternative lifestyles in a self-claimed city named “Slab City,” located in the desert of Imperial County, California. I recommend Googling and reading about their highly interesting lifestyles as well.





<br><hr>

I think it's sad that living a simple, sustainable life can be relegated to a display of privilege by those who are fortunate enough to have the money, education, and leisure to make these changes. But the truth is often depressing. That's why I think it's important that as we shift towards renewables and eco-friendly lifestyles, we simultaneously create systems that help transition those who would otherwise be unable. But that answer isn't good enough in this case, is it? How do we handle those who work in construction, farming, and other equipment intensive jobs? Your are right to expose the problems of expecting everyone to seamlessly change and adapt to this new way of life, however simply saying that the change has a high cost is the exact reason why nothing has been done the climate crisis up until now.  We could continue to allow them to drive their work trucks despite their negative impact to the environment. We could incentivize electrically powered equipment through a series of grants and tax breaks. There are other options out there that could benefit people like your Dad, and the environment. 
<br><br>

I don't see how casting blame, from either side, is beneficial to our situation. The climate crisis is here, and it is the responsibility of everybody to make the appropriate changes. Creating discourse at this point is just counterproductive.





<br><hr>
I really appreciate your comment because it did not occur to me how Peter and his family were able to live that lifestyle because they were very educated and comfortably in the middle class. I had only applaud how he and his family emit one-tenth of what the average American emit because I am ashamed to admit that my greenhouse emission is more than what the average American emit. As a result, I had only admired his accomplishments and did not think beyond that surface information. Although his accomplishment definitely deserves some recognition, his affluent background does play a role in his ability to sustain that lifestyle. I realize this after you talked about the background of your parents, so I thank you for sharing. It goes to show that one's financial situation and background play a large role on how one maintains their lifestyle.





<br><hr>

I cannot agree with you more. In fact, throughout this quarter, my responces are mainly focused on how average people are limited or impossible to practice things such as minimalism. And your responce demonstrates what I was exactly worried about. Not all of us can live with bike as the ONLY means of daily transportation. My hometown was known for mountainous landscape which makes it impossible to ride a bike for daily usage, unless you eant to break a leg or two. Yet still, as educated young generation, no matter what others do, we need to take our relative small resposibility to realize a greater future.




<br><hr>


I think you touch on a really important idea here that access to an education is essential for understanding what impact our carbon footprint has on the planet regardless of geographical location around the world.  I believe the changes being made in Asia by the average citizen will be different than the changes made the average American citizen.  The climate crisis is a global issue and it should be thought of as an issue that everyone in the world should try fixing in their own way.  A global perspective is very important in addressing this issue.



<br><hr>
I agree that I can be overwhelming to see something so inspiring, while keeping in mind the reality of your circumstances. Many of us feel that we do not have the means (financial or other) to implement a lot of these changes in a meaningful way. While some of these lifestyle changes obviously require more commitments than others, it's important to start small and make changes that are sensible to you individually. Once you succeed at that change, implement another one and continue this cycle within your capacity. It's also important to acknowledge the underlying systemic issues that prevent us from acquiring the financial means to really make large-scale changes. I think climate action needs to be taken with consideration of both individual and societal constraints. Asking yourself why these limitations exist and trying to change that personally with your individual lifestyle decisions and as part of the larger society through political means and activism are crucial steps in taking effective climate action.

I totally agree with you. These types of films are extremely encouraging. I feel what we can lack from this course is how people without comfortable jobs and below middle class can live sustainably without having a detrimental effect to their children or their finances. It reminded me of the couple the Kalamus family met. They completely turned around their lifestyle and their house. Solar panels and clean energy, but there was no doubt that was expensive as heck! He even said it, but, then he also states that he did this little by little. Even then, it can be discouraging when families depend on systems and resources to thrive especially when they can be one paycheck away from struggle. It would be ideal for everyone to ride a bike and what if that happened? To keep people on bikes, gas prices would go up, making it even harder for you parents to get around with supplies because it is way too expensive! Yes, even a small lifestyle change is impactful, but I think we are past the point of “small” changes. I wonder how we would deal with practical situations like these...




<br><hr>

I really agree with what you said. In this chaos society, a lot of environmental resources are wasted. In order to use that limited resource in the most practical way. What we should do in obligation is to keep our lives to be as green as we can and save the resource as much as we can as well. For me, as a student at UCSB, riding a bike on weekdays instead of driving to school is the best way to show my altitude to the green life. Decreasing personal carbonic emission will contribute less pollution to the environment. No matter is true that my effect is tiny, but keep on doing will still affect a lot.




<br><hr>


You make a very compelling point here. I completely agree that living this way is really only possible when you are predisposed to it. A lack of education and financial resources is a large hinderance in living sustainably in our country. In other countries, I would say this is not the case. People living in poverty contribute little to nothing to the climate crisis, only because poverty in America is much different than it is in a country in Africa for example. Less affluent Americans without an education have to typically do manual labor to make a living, and much of this, like you mentioned, requires supplies that must be brought to work and some form of commute, which would be difficult in public transportation settings due to the need to bring those supplies. We cannot just eradicate all forms of these types of jobs as we all need them, but I agree that extremely wealthy people can cut down on their emissions to make up for the people who really can't.



<br><hr>

I agree, this film does not present a very accessible way of changing habits to save the environment. The large majority of America is part of the lower and middle classes. Most Americans do not have the funds, energy or time to do some of the things presented in this movie. However, I do not think Ken is pointing fingers and blaming everything on the lower class, either. All of the upper class U.S. citizens are the reason we are in this Climate Crisis and all they do is point fingers at the lower class and blame it on them for, perhaps, getting a meal at McDicks or Taco Smell (I actually have no hard feelings towards Taco Bell because they have great vegan options).
<br><br>
I also am a big believer that small lifestyle changes DO lead to overall bigger changes. If everyone believes that their single choice will be drowned out by the rest of the planet doing nothing, then nothing will change! Most revolutionary social movements start with small grassroots movements (unless, of course, the movement is fueled by personal wealth. Which is clearly not how the climate movement is going to come about, as the upper class do not care because they caused all of this).




<br><hr>
I enjoy reading your comment since you relate your personal situation with the topic, which makes the film more critical. Just like you said, the family in the film has enough economic support on living in a fulfilling but sustainable lifestyle with keeping climate crisis in their mind. Of course, I admire their lifestyle, but how could ordinary family that is not that wealthy afford for this transition of lifestyle. In order to living environmentally, we should replace our cars with bikes, replace McMansions with co-housing, replace meet-based diet to plant-based diet. However, making these changes means people have to give up almost everything they had before, and spend money on new houses and transportation equipments. It won’t be an easy thing to do for a family with average income. As it comes to income, Ken mentions that income about $75,000 and over won’t increase one’s happiness anymore. The statistics is quite ridiculous to me since that’s about a year's tuition for me. If my parents only have that amount of income, it must be difficult for my family to survive while supporting for my education, not to be happy. Anyway, I still support for the lifestyle that emits less greenhouse gas. This film makes me see the hope again to minimize climate crisis by making personal changes and encourages me to make such changes. At last, I will go along with you that a lifestyle change will have a profound impact on our planet and society, no matter how small it is.

I totally agree with you! And I also consider the “ meditating” part as interesting and practical. It can not only do good to our attitude to the world,  but other it changes us from inner side. I do believe that it can show us what we really want and what we do not. Maybe I’ll never go on such a trip with vegetable oil,  but I really want to try it for real. And the saddest thing his that. For us international students, we can’t avoid flying, but we can do something else such as buying a second-hand car. Live what we really think it’s right, that’s how we can being the change.

I completely agree with you and the situation you are in makes complete sense, however, I don't think "Being the Change" is directed towards families or situations like yours. I think "Being the Change" is for people who are constantly spending money to gain some sort of short-lived happiness in return, which is inevitably destructing our planet. This film helps people understand that happiness does not mean more materialistic things. As you said, the combination of science and spirituality is very appealing and I think it is because this film speaks about how spiritually you can become happier as you have fewer things. The less we have creates fewer problems not only for us but more the climate. In your case, your family is not spending money on wasteful things and creating wasteful habits, instead, they are just living a simple life and of course, we can not eliminate everything such as your cars. One of my favorite parts of the film was the concept that he made regarding "head, hand, and heart". The head meant intellectually looking at problems using science and figuring out the many problems we must tackle. The hand represents actually doing stuff to help the environment such as gardening and fixing cars. The heart ties everything together because it is where you find meaning and make life more satisfying. Altogether, I think this film made an excellent representation of how we can make a lifestyle change that will increase our wellbeing and help the environment at the same time.

I am really impressed that Kulmas would devote himself to environmental protection after he graduated from Caltech as a technically superior researcher at the LIGO gravitational wave site. As said in Ken’s video, I would expect him to rely on his hope for new technologies, like electric cars, etc. However, as such a person, he chose to change into environmental science and try to use the least carbon he could with his family. He is no doubt admirable and quite fit with my experiences. I am an astrophysics student and am taking this course, and I think about working out of the environmental crisis through technological advancement. However, what he did truly drew me back into consideration, do we really need much technological advancement to work out of the problem? What should I do for the environment? When I was taking env s 1, I joked with the professor that “we need 5 more Einstein to save human beings.” However, is that true?
<br><br>
For myself and my career, I think no changes would be made, but as long as l know climate change, I would try my best first to switch to a low carbon lifestyle.

I too loved the film this week. The importance of living a simple life is detrimental to our planet's well being and Peter Kalmus did just that. In the film Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, Peter Kalmus demonstrates how an individual can spark global change. Peter decided to move his family to California to work at Caltech. He bought a new home where he began to write his book under the avocado tree in the backyard. He began to make notable life changes all while writing about a) having an intellectual understanding of the environmental repercussions of your actions, b)taking action to improve the way you live, and c) translating this understanding and practical action into meaningful endeavors that inspire others to do the same. Kalmus sparked change in all parts of his life and lowered his environmental footprint to 1/10 of an average American. He reduced his carbon emissions by a factor of 10 by creating a car that runs on vegetable oil, becoming vegan, riding a bike, choosing not to fly, and only having two children. While most of the films we have watched this quarter have been intellectual and informative only a few have been as inspiring as this one. This film kept me attentive the entire time and made me want to make environmental changes in my own life. If people choose to follow some of the changes the Klamus made in his life our planet and our people could be better. By lowering your carbon footprint and taking time out of your day to meditate positive changes could be made in all parts of life. Kalmus is an amazing example of the very few people who are willing to put the planet before themselves.

I agree with Jocelyn about the family's financial decisions regarding climate change.  Of course, everyone wants to help fight against climate change but some are more able to help than others.  To agree with everyone that low-income families can not change their lifestyles as easily as some wealthy families because the many rely on their type of lifestyles to make a living and sometimes not always is their lifestyle of making a living wage is the most eco-friendly way but they can not afford to find a more eco-friendly way to adjust their lifestyle while making their income.  As for me, my parents have to drive to work because their jobs are not around the corner.  My dad has to drive at least an hour to get to work and coming back home after work it takes at least 2 hours because of traffic and it would just not be possible with a bike or any other transportation, and no the train is available to them because it does not go in the direction of their job.  Overall, I agree with the financial aspect of adjusting the carbon footprint that the wealthy having it easier adjusting to reducing carbon footprint as anything for the wealthy is easier for them.

The film “Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution” introduces the main thoughts and solutions to reduce the emissions of CO2. Peter Kalmus considered climate change as a science fiction 2 decades ago, but with the birth of his first baby, he realized that climate change has been worsen so he decided to be a change of stopping, at least slowing down this trend. As Peter said, to achieve the goal that is stopping global warming, we have three words to remember: head, hands, and heart. So I learned that I should first intellectually understand the problem, which is global warming by understanding the science behind it. Then I am supposed to connect my thoughts and hands making a change as my own individual contribution of slowing down trend of global warming. Peter mentioned several ways of lowering his carbon footprint in his daily life such as not to fly, to ride a bike, this kind of low carbon trip mode. Moreover, I was very surprised when he talks about their trips on waste vegetable oil. I agree with him that every individual contribution is like a tiny drop and only everyone in the world take actions aimed at the same goal can we successfully protect our living environment. At the end of this movie, some of Peter’s friends talks about other ways about service in community like free repair, or about carbon fee, etc. and I appreciate these solutions to a large extent and believe that they can have a profound influence on lessening consumption. After all, I find this documentary effective at conveying its call of viewers’ participation.

I thought the film 'Being the Change' was so sweet.  I felt the family that the documentary was centered around gave a great perspective into how it is not about one specific action being taken by all Americans.  Rather, each person considering their lifestyle and how they might be able to mitigate some of the waste they produce.  This family did what they could within their lifestyle.  They didn't seem to be atrociously wealthy, but were clearly well educated and had many opportunities and freedoms afforded to them.  This film inspired me to seek discomfort.  The greater good is just such a reasonable cause, that it seems like, how could you not? How could you not at least consider adjusting your life if it could mean such a higher quality of life overall for everyone.  But this is selfless thinking, this is forward thinking, and not everyone is here yet.  Losing creature comforts and not an attractive option, especially if you can't see immediate results.  Especially if you don't live in a highly populated area or are less inclided towards all for one, one for all thinking.  I guess it just really seems impossible that there could ever be one single solution to the entire climate crisis, so we might as well take personal steps to lower the overall rates that are influencing the collapse of our planet.



<br><hr>


I feel like it rests on people able to financially able to make changes to their living to live out more economical lives. It's much harder if you're trying to live paycheck to paycheck and worry about your climate footprint on top it. However a richer family would most likely output more emissions than a less well off one, solely on the face that they can afford to live in such giant places, buy multiple cars, and vacation using airplanes. Once the people that are able to make these changes come together and become activists and change the culture that we live in, less people will have to worry about living paycheck to paycheck. There are more things that a richer person can do to help combat climate change because they are more likely to be the ones to have already emitted more carbon into the atmosphere and they should be able to use their position to fight for change that allows everyone to live a better life.



<br><hr>
These problems you identified provide interesting scenarios affect many of the middle and lower class. Blue collard workers need transportation to move heavy equipment for their hands-on job projects. How can you expect families that can only afford to eat at fast food restaurants to indulge in a plant based diet from mother gardens. My response is for the wealthy to take this into consideration, providing all the more reason for them to do these things because they have it easier. Calling the rich to not waste their food, because others do not have the luxuries of having healthy food everyday. Those in the upper class should not feel the need to increase their carbon footprint just because they are successful enough to do so. For the rest of the population, do what you can. Make the effort staying committed to a couple practices instead of being halfway committed to many new behaviors. 

<br><br>

What is saddening is that almost everyone can be on board with the sacrifices and embody their role in being the change,  and all a Kardashian has to do to offset this positive change from thousands of selfless people is hop on a jet to be at the grand opening at another one of her makeup stores. This really makes me re-evaluate my definition of success, which is more than just buying excess things in false pursuits of happiness cause you can.

I've watched this film last year in Eng 22, and I found the film "Being the Change" very calm and relaxing too. Moreover, I completely agree with you when you mention about some wealthy people's wasteful life. While Dr. Kalmas showed us many ways that we could shift to a more sustainable lifestyle, one thing he might not realize is that many of us are unable to make a change in our life because choices we have now are all we have left. I especially understand you when you said your parents are trying their hardest every day in order to provide you and your sister a better future because my parents are the same. My dad’s work requires him to drive everywhere around LA and my mom needs a car to go to work and to take my brother and sister home after school. Compared to those who take flight on vacation or business trips year-a-round, I would say we are way more sustainable. I also believe that when talking about changes we could make in our lives in order to reduce our carbon emission, we should definitely encourage people to take steps within their capability.



<br><hr>
I cannot agree more with your comment! It was warming to watch this film, seeing a family living a simplistic lifestyle that is sustainable and being very happy. Like you, I think it is amazing that the family has chosen this lifestyle, as this means an entire family's carbon emission will be cut! But I couldn't help but think that how many people can actually live the way they live. Not many families are as financially comfortable enough to be able to sustain a lifestyle like the one shown in the film. Another point you made is that the family is obviously very educated and know how to navigate the lifestyle they live. However, these factors do not ring true for many average families that either live paycheck to paycheck or aren't educated to know how to live sustainably. This brings into question privilege and how wealthier, educated families have the option to choose this lifestyle while poorer, less educated families do not. Your remark about wealthy Americans looking down on impoverished families really spoke to me because it really angers me that these judgement are made without consideration of circumstances related to privilege. Overall, I did enjoy the movie as the message was good and encouraged living a sustainable lifestyle. Although I cannot live the exact same way, I will make sustainable choices in my daily life when I can.





<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. I loved how this family was able to live happily with using just 1/10th of what the average American uses. It is interesting how he was able to mix spirituality and science together when it comes to the climate crisis. You bring up a good point that they could easily pull this off due to their socioeconomic class. I agree that it would be harder for lower classes to make the changes that they can make. I am on the same boat as you. It is irritating how the rich blame the poor when they absolutely have more resources.


<br><hr>

I get this impulse, but I have to wonder... well.. is it supposed to be for everyone? 
<br><br>

Do we honestly think that the target audience of this video is the poorest people in America, people who are constantly living paycheck-to-paycheck, those who physically cannot accommodate more carbon-neutral lifestyles? 
<br><br>

I'd say the answer here is a resounding "no." They're not the target, who's trying to be reached. They're trying to reach those people that are well-off, that can afford to do and have less. People without the means can't restrict their carbon intake as much, but those with the means absolutely can; if you control your employment, where and how you work, have options for things, etc, then you can choose the more climate-conscious paths. I really think it's as straightforward as this. 
<br><br>

And honestly, I think this relates to a lot of climate discourse in general. A lot of people, whenever someone brings up going vegetarian or driving less or etc etc etc, says that it's just not possible for, say, someone living in a food desert, or someone not living near public transport, or [excuses]. And they're right! Those criticisms are absolutely right, but they're also besides the point. People are not going to the most impoverished places in America and telling people to go vegan... our professor, for example, is lecturing at a liberal arts university where most students are, as you say here, around "comfortably middle class" (with very, very real exceptions). When this film, or our professor, or climate activists in general, talk about how we should be changing our habits, I do think that a target audience should very much be kept in mind. They're talking to the people that can change, and that are often using the justification of "poor people can't do this" as to avoid doing anything themselves. Let's not fall into that trap!




<br><hr>
I was thinking the exact same problem as you when watching the movie. The lifestyle in the movie is intriguing and environmental-friendly. However, the family can do that is because they have enough capital and education to make the changes that are fully in their control. However, how can people living in a lower social-status and the countless communities in less developed countries resonate and implement this kind of lifestyle? If a lifestyle is only practical towards a group of people, its practicality should be questioned. 
<br><br>
I really appreciate this film that it sheds light on the problem and provide a solution for some people to make changes. It truly brings hope. I will continue to make changes in my personal lifestyle to do good to the environment. However, I think we, human beings as a whole, should come up with a better solution, a solution that has universally practicality, which can be implemented by everyone. That solution truly needs more education, more government intervenes, more economic investments to build up better infrastructures...With everything all comes together, the solution will become more practical.




<br><hr>

I think what Ken is trying to address here is to prove that doing what we can to be as sustainable as possible through individual actions can really be a big deal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The film "being the change" shows how one family commits to this eco-friendly lifestyle and reduces their greenhouse emissions to 1/10 of the average American's climate footprint. Through biking, being freegan, abandoning flying, and meditation, they use their own actions to deliver an important message: individual actions can work, and by living life like this, people can even live healthier and happier. 
<br><br>


Every person and every family has a different situation. You pointed out that choosing biking as the only way of transportation is not gonna be manageable for your family. In the film, they still keep a car because they have two kids. And having two kids even goes against the solutions to combat the climate crisis mentioned by Ken. However, they still manage to keep their emissions far under the average. We don't have to 100% copy what the family does in the film -- we can develop our own plan for our own family. Just stay aware and keep communicating and practicing, it is meaningful even there is only one person is influenced by you and me.  


<br><br>

You also imply another a greater point: inequality, which I think ties strongly to social and climate justice, and voting. We need policies to ensure that there is a better infrastructure for people to bike more efficiently and safely. We need policies to ensure everyone is paying attention to what they do to the environment, instead of wealthier people adding more burden to the poorer.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with what you said as I come from a similar financial background as you. It is extremely difficult for some people to make changes for the environment which may negatively impact them. Being the change was really interesting because it dived into a family life where they were working together to decrease their own emission. While this was a great thing and shows that people can change their lives in some way it does not apply to everybody like you said. Some people have to do certain things because they have to support their family and cant afford to worry about their emission. Realistically being the change is just another case of action which half of the country refuses to act on. I would also like to reduce my emission so that means that I have to avoid doing things that I normally do. This is no easy task as we were raised as a generation to consume as much as we want rather than as much as we need.




<br><hr>
I really enjoyed this comment because this is something that many people often forget to think about when it comes to climate change. The wealthy have so much more power to make a change than those who are less fortunate. As much as a person/family wants to be environmentally friendly and help with the environment, sometimes a family is not in a position where they can make those alterations to their lives due to money. There are many people who are in stable financial situations who could easily make changes to their lives that would significantly benefit the environment. Unfortunately, a lot of the time those people do not make the changes out of sheer laziness. Then you have those who may not have as much money but really do want to take some sort of action but really can't because of their financial positions. It is frustrating and sad to see people with money doing the least for the environment.





<br><hr>
I agree with that you said here, especially your conclusion that “no matter how small a lifestyle change is, it will have a profound impact on the planet and society as a whole”. I think this is the attitude that people can have to try their best to “save the planet”. I also like how this film vividly and specifically shows us various different ways to live a sustainable and happy life. I think many of Peter’s lifestyles changes can also be applied to my life such as biking constantly, freeganism, meditation, and reducing flights as much as possible. However, I also think that some of Peter’s changes are relatively difficult for people like me who are not proficient at technology to implement such as convert waste kitchen oil into car fuel. Regarding another change Peter made – composting, I appreciate how he has done so well on a personal level, but I also think that composting can probably be more efficiently conducted on a community level. Since every household has compost wastes, instead of having a composting site at each household, it would probably be more efficient if all households’ composts are collected and treated collectively. 
 <br><br>

Peter not only shows us the environmental impacts of living a sustainable life but also its personal and societal impacts. Seeing how Peter and his family live a happy, fulfilled, and meaningful life by simplifying the external and materialistic accumulations but internal and spiritual fulfillment makes me rethink about the path to happiness and meaning. Peter is a very good example of being the change he wants to see in the world, and by doing so he has also been gradually affecting his community. Perter, in his way of living a sustainable life, also learnt to develop a better relationship with people around him and find peace in himself. This movie thoroughly shows me how personal actions can make an impact on our climate, which I found to be helpful, instructive, and encouraging.





<br><hr>


I would agree that not everyone has the means to do all the things this family did. Most people probably don't. This is a very real part of the climate crisis, and I think it makes dealing with it as an individual much harder. This highlights the importance of public policy, and enacting laws that will make bigger changes than we can as individuals.



<br><hr>

While watching the movie, I was thinking the same thing you said, this family seems to live a full life, and it's sustainable. To me, the family was in their own world, as happy as they were in their own little community. Their lifestyle changes seem simple and easy, such as cycling around, growing their own produce, and giving free food to their neighbors. This really gave me hope, because my father mentioned that even with this mindset and making small changes, your lifestyle will eventually go a long way, but over time. I was surprised when he said it took him four years to reduce emissions by more than 10 times that amount, because it seemed too long. However, their current lifestyle greatly compensates for this. I still can't help but think of all the "what if". As you mentioned, I immediately thought of my own family and how difficult this lifestyle was for them. My parents sometimes had to travel long distances to pay the bills and allow me to come here. In addition, the family of my closest friend had to clean up various parts of the town, which made things like riding a bike unreasonable. Still, there are plenty of alternatives to using a bike, and my family certainly can. As mentioned in the movie, what needs to be done is to get more people involved in sustainable development to witness large-scale change.




<br><hr>


You brought up an interesting point about how this family was able to do so because they are very well educated and living comfortably in middle class. This statement is so true in the sense that it is a lot easier for certain people who have the means to do so to suddenly change their lifestyle to fit one that is more sustainable. For other families who have not been able to receive such a high education and to those who may not earn as much money, it will become more of a burden to suddenly change their lifestyle. However, I do strongly applaud the efforts of the family in the way in which they were able to slash their climate impact to under a tenth of the U.S. average and become happier in the process. I strongly believe that this is just a model example of what could potentially be and not what has to be. Each family has different circumstances and ways of living but if everyone worked together to slowly make little changes in their lifestyle, we will be able to make that much more of an impact on our planet and environment. No one way is the set way but every individual can embark on the journey to change their own life as well as the world. I really enjoyed this film because it showed that living sustainably on ONE TENTH of the fossil fuels of the average American can be done. The message behind this film is extremely optimistic of a new world in which we can live in and leaves me feeling hopeful for our world as well.



<br><hr>

I agree that while this film is great in many ways, it does only take into account a certain lifestyle and a specific set of circumstances. There are many people who have to emit certain levels of fossil fuels because they don't have the same opportunities available as Kalmus has. This also has to do with infrastructure, so there is possibility that eventually these options will be presented to everyone, but the simple fact is that right now this is not a realistic option for many American families. I do hope that most American families can watch this and find specific actions that they can take and that they will reduce their own climate footprints by as much as is realistically possible for them at the moment, but there is almost no way that they can do all of these actions and still maintain a good, healthy lifestyle. It's a very important distinction that needs to be made and I'm very glad that you brought it up here.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with what you say. it is very uplifting to see people live a sustainable and simple life when they can easily live in a larger home with lots of stuff. It would be nice to be able to just bike everywhere and lower my carbon footprint but I just can't see myself being able to do it. Not as though I do not want to do it but I how will I get to where I need to go both just my bike or how would my parents need to go places with just their bike. My family and I are a lower class family and my parents don't have the same education as the people in the film. It kind of shows that you need to reach certain point of education or income in order to be living the same type of sustainable lifestyle.



<br><hr>

I wanted to challenge you by asking if you think you, personally, would be more likely to switch your lifestyle up completely because of a celebrity's influence, or from seeing something more relatable. Although average and "lame", I feel like this would, and did, inspire me more than if Kim Kardashian, who has every resource imaginable at her disposal. This average family made it work in the same way I probably could. Just because this lifestyle is and will be opposed by others who have different ways of living doesn't mean it can't appeal to other masses. If this lifestyle was exposed to the population and encouraged, imagine how much we could decrease our global footprint. We need to decrease our food waste, too. I wish I could have started purging my belongings earlier. This has inspired me so much to begin.




<br><hr>


I understand your frustration. It is a privilege to live an environmentally conscious life in America right now because of the costs associated with living green. This divide is seen in the way food is sold. It is cheaper to buy processed foods because of the lower cost of production, therefore forcing less wealthy families to settle for GMOs, non-organic produce, etc. Education is another huge barrier to a green lifestyle. Poorer areas of America have a deficit in their education system. And even when children are taught to eat better, or choose healthier alternatives, these actions are not always feasible for their families. A lack of choice prevents many from taking a greener or more sustainable route. I loved the film because of its scale, showing that personal (privileged) choices can have a huge impact on local community and environment. This is why education is such an important part of moving towards a sustainable future. I believe investing in education first would be a huge step in the right direction for environmental activists. The more people willing to subscribe to living this way, the more people there are living for a brighter future.



<br><hr>

I agree, "Being the Change" was a very heart warming film seeing how simple life could be and still be happy. Similar to you, while I was watching, I couldn't help but think, how would I be able to do this in my day to day college life? or what about the thousands of other students in Isla Vista? Sometimes I feel like there is not enough time in the day to even grab a sandwich in between classes that's wrapped in plastic which already makes me feel guilty. How could I possibly bike from UCSB to downtown Santa Barbara to make it to work on time? I need to drive simply because of the huge time difference it makes. While I do feel guilty for doing this, it just doesn't seem practical for me and many other college students. As I would love to be able for everyone to live as simply as the family in "Being the Change", it does only seem accessible to some.




<br><hr>


I also loved this week's film. I do agree that it is much easier to make the transition to an environmentally-friendly for those who are financially comfortable, and that people should not try to place the blame on anyone other than themselves, especially those who do not share many of the same privileges that they have. Unfortunately, the majority of the solutions we have discussed in this class are unrealistic for many Americans, and not because of personal choice. I think that is part of why personal lifestyle changes can only do so much. Somehow, we as a country need to make fighting the climate crisis a possibility for all, regardless of socioeconomic background. I absolutely believe that this is possible, as shown by Costa Rica, a country that is not nearly as wealthy on average as the United States, but it must be done on a federal level, not a personal one. The government needs to step up, and we need to ensure that it does. If a change in lifestyle is a realistic possibility for someone, then I think they definitely should make that change, but it is unfair to expect everyone to make these changes without help.

This is the point that always bothers me in so many accusatory posts, articles, or social media threads from extremist vegans/climate fighters or upper class/wealthy individuals- they point fingers at those who simply cannot afford to completely drop the lifestyle they have now in favor of a traditionally climate friendly lifestyle. My hometown is primarily lower to middle class families. These are families where none to very little have formal education beyond high school, and so they have to work a grueling amount to make ends meet for their families. This often results in them working in commercial farming, using personal vehicles more, or eating more meat-based diets because meat is relatively cheap and can be stored for long periods of time. People who are more affluent are eagerly judgmental of people like this without realizing that many of their habits are just as bad, if not worse.
 <br><br>

I know a few people who I can tell are judgmental when I mention or do something that isn't traditionally environmentally friendly, like getting a drink in a single-use cup (even if it's compostable). But these are also people who fly fairly frequently over long distances, or who constantly use personal cars when they're at home. My family and I hardly travel beyond California, and most families in my hometown almost never travel further than 2-3 hours away, and even less have been on planes. I think it reflects why so many people aren't eager to join the movement- they are highly aware of the stigma surrounding the attitudes of extremists in the movement, and they perceive that to be how everyone in the movement is like. Everyone has to realize that literally almost everyone you know is probably at least trying to do SOMETHING to help climate change, both in big and small ways. People should not be so quick to judge how someone's lifestyle might affect the planet without self-reflecting and evaluating first.

I agree. It’s easy for the upper and middle class to say that they are happy reducing their emissions, but the real burden is put on those who don’t have other options. If we want to reduce emissions, it needs to start from the upper and middle class funding infrastructure change to allow more options for the less fortunate. Funding the creation of more subway lines, bus only lanes, and other forms of public transportation would help everyone.



<br><hr>



I really agree with what you said here. The lifestyle changes they made seemed simple and easy like riding their bike everywhere or growing their own produce and giving out food for free to their neighbors. One or two people change their lifestyle definitely will not be enough, actually far from enough to solve the problem we are facing right now. Many people do not know the effects and dangers the climate crisis brings to not only us but to future generations.They absolutely know how bad they are doing, and they do want to help the Earth, but it takes time.

I agree with you in this comment. In this week's film, "Being the Change", I also enjoyed the idea of a climate crisis conscious family living their life with care. The fact that his family only emits 1/10th of what the average American does is very impressive; it sets a good example for what is realistically possible for most people.  Except.. for the people that you mention in your comment. Lots of environmentally conscious actions are not feasible for the poor to undergo. Most vegan options are still more expensive than non vegan options. Like you said, bicycles, while great for the environment, aren't able to store that many items. Making them not a realistic option for people that have jobs that require lots of storage space. At the same time though, the ideal family shown in the film may just be intimidating for some people, as their lifestyle is drastically different than their own. There is a lot to think about here with this week's film. I am curious what the cut off is.

In the first 15 minutes of the film 'Being the Change', I was admittedly off-put by the focus on meditation and the like, dismissing some of their points as coming from unrealistic hippies (especially when I first heard 'House of Peace'). Near the end of the documentary, however, I began to realize the significance of that section, and it has a lot to do with Buddhist concepts, theory, and philosophy. 
 <br><br>


The moment that stuck out to me was when Peter mentioned the 'middle path'. Siddhartha Gautama famously was born into a life of luxury, able to satisfy any of his material desires as he pleased. Perhaps modern American society would envy his lifestyle at that point. When Siddhartha began his journey as an aesthetic to become enlightened, he found that this other extreme of letting go of everything, even many of the things he needed to live (Jain aesthetics often starved themselves), was also unfulfilling. The result was the 'middle path' that he took, which inspired much of Buddhist philosophy from that central concept. That same concept is what I believe Peter was referring to: we can live fulfilling lives with a minimal amount of resources taken from the Earth. While Peter did not cut his climate footprint down completely, he got it down to 1/10th of the American average. He did not live alone in the forest, foraging for berries. He lived in Pasadena, contributing to modern climate science at JPL while having two children. His life is exemplary of the 'middle path' put into action on the climate. 

 <br><br>

The other important part, as Peter notes, is to not only be the change, but make that known. This is where personal action can easily and organically grow, when the climate conscious person actively shares their lifestyle in their community, and uses it to support others. That is exactly where the 'House of Peace' comes in. While not every person needs to operate their house like that, having someone like that in every community I believe is essential to furthering personal climate action block-by-block.

I had very similar thoughts about the film "Being the Change". The beginning of the film was a little hard to grasp at first, but then it brought the ideas together and then I was like okay, this film has a applicable meaning. I also, liked the emphasis on the Siddartha. Displaying how coming from wealth and abundance one can still find the path to minimize. I think this concept really tied the film together wanted spread this amongst people like us. I really enjoyed this film.

I was honestly not a hug fan of this film compared to some of the other ones that we had watched in the earlier segments of this class. The thing, for me, is that so much of this film seemed so far out and if I were not in this class I do not believe that I would have finished this film, it seemed to lack a lot of what many people would consider realistic standpoints. If I was trying to convince someone that the climate change was indeed happening this would not be one of the films that I would consider showing them first. I do believe that the film did have sections that were interesting. My favorite section of your comment was when you explained that Peter states that it is not to only be the change, but make that known. Many of the points brought up in this film were, as you said, more philosophical. I think it is very important to note that not all people need to follow the ways of live and lifestyles depicted in the film. The best thing to do in this situation and the one thing that I would hope many people would take away from this film would be to listen to the messages and not get so caught up in the film making and the people they display. I hope that although this might not be peoples favorite film, like it was not mine, but I hope people still listen to the messages the film is trying to convey.

When watching the film, “Being the Change” it was really inspirational to see a person’s lifestyle still be good and contribute a lot less carbon into the atmosphere than a normal personals daily life in America. This film made me reevaluate my everyday lifestyle and if there are things that I can change or do within my daily life to be able to lessen the amount of carbon that I put out into the atmosphere. The transportation issue is something that I try to work on a lot, as I prefer to take the bus or the bike wherever I go in order to put less emissions into the atmosphere. Seeing personal action in play was extremely inspiring. It made me consider everything and try and work on it.

When I watched the beginning of the movie "Changing", I was a little confused about its relationship with climate change. It has been talking about the importance of meditation and serving others. Then I realized that it was more focused on personal behavior and the meaning behind it. For example, most of the time people think that the bins are filled with worthless trash. However, this person has a great idea to bring the perfect food to the park and show people what they do. I also really like the idea of ​​head, hands and heart. I think this is a good description of how much people dedicate when they take certain actions.
 <br><br>
I thought the film was insightful and inspiring, but I struggled with the authenticity of the film. They have a compost station and garden in the backyard, and a unique waste disposal system. They drive vegetable oil-powered cars and ride bicycles in most places. Although all of this sounds good and is very environmentally friendly, I'm not sure if the average American family can do it. These adults are well educated and have years of experience in science and repairing used items. My father is a scientist and knows how to make all these things. Although I'm eager to find a solution, I'm not sure if all of these approaches are applicable. I absolutely believe in some areas, such as cycling and planting gardens. I think we can put it into practice and slowly integrate it into life.

Having watched and enjoyed both of these films I must say that I thought Tomorrow was excellently done and had more of an impact on me personally. I really loved how this film stressed all the creative alternatives that can be found all over the world and it brings me hope to know that these systems are surviving and thriving. I loved how in Calderdale people just began planting food everywhere to help combat hunger as well as climate change, and I think this is such an easy thing for any city to do. I loved learning about the Permaculture in France and how effective it was, and wish to someday have a permaculture garden of my own. I also was very pleased that there is a factory in France that is completely green and they do everything sustainably and save a ton of money from it too. I also loved the talk of local currencies and a change in the education system, and all these amazing alternatives fill me with a lot of hope. Change is possible and it is slowly happening around the world. If only more people knew of the success of these stories and wanted to follow suit. I would love to see all of these changes implemented in America and even in my city, and I hope that we as a nation can see that there is a way better, more just way to do things that is no longer an option, but a necessity.

I also found “Tomorrow” to be a more impactful film than “Being the Change,” because it looked at so many different places and people rather than focusing on just one family. While I do think that both small scale and larger scale examples of how we can combat climate change are important, “Tomorrow” is more relatable because it is less limited. “Tomorrow” takes the audience all over the world from lower income communities in Detroit to farms in France, making it highly relatable for many different audiences. It is really encouraging to see that there are so many countries that are 
 <br><br>


Another part of the film that I found particularly interesting, as you mentioned in your comment, was the idea of a local currency. Prior to watching this film I had no idea that this type of system existed or how it would play a role in helping to mitigate the climate crisis. The local currencies limit the need to import goods, which takes emissions, because people are encouraged to shop locally. If more small towns were to implement a local currency it could significantly cut down people’s obsession with online shopping or shopping at companies that practice unethical and unsustainable business. 

 <br><br>

Seeing all the different developments in gardening was also really interesting because the film showed how it can be done in several different environments. Not everyone lives where they have a large backyard suitable for the large scale permaculture seen in France, but even people in the city can work in community gardens where they practice urban farming. It is also such a great idea to plant small gardens in unexpected places such as Incredible Edible does in Todmorden because it is making the most of the small areas of undeveloped land that we have left while also providing food for anyone who needs it.  
 <br><br>


While I agree that this film is quite inspiring, it can also be so frustrating to see that all of these countries are making changes while America does little to nothing to help our dire situation. Americans emit a very large percent of the world’s CO2 and we still have people in government that oppose The Green New Deal and any other changes that could actually make a difference. We need to take a step back as a country and look to these other countries as examples of what we are doing wrong environmentally, as well as with our education system. In the film they focus on Finland as an example of an effective education system that is able to teach children in a way that the next generation will be prepared to deal with the unfortunate mess that we will leave them. With free education people are less concerned with the burden of student loans and are therefore more focused on and dedicated to their studies. We desperately need to consider just how important education is because we are raising the next leaders of our country.

For this weeks film, "Being the Change" I thought that it was really nice to hear that a parent wants to do better for their kids and their futures. This is what a lot of people nowadays have to take into consideration whether they like it or not because our planet is so damaged. I was not really sure what to expect from the film as it started, but I was definitely interested as to how it would end up. I feel like portraying a family and how their lifestyle looks like being considerate of our environment is a great way to make people want to do better. Having the home videos and parents talking about doing what's best for their kids and their lives is a great way to convince folks to at least try. I especially like the scene where they introduced Pancho, and how he lives his life. I was so surprised at the way he lived as well, and how they talked about him. He did a lot of meditation, and that was his way of treating people better and fixing themselves in order to better their relationships with others. The film was a lot of mixture of personal and how that has to do with our everyday lives in being more considerate to our surroundings. My favorite  scene was when Peter was addressing how it helped him stop the negativity he was giving to others especially his family, and how we tend to give that type of energy to our families because it's not as easy to do that to a stranger. Overall, I feel like this film was not at all what I expected (in a good way), and the way it mixed personal with bettering our environment and ourselves was really smart.

This film “Being the Change” had a great message. With skeptics and deniers of the climate crisis, sometimes you do not know how to acknowledge and refute them. This film addressed that knowing the facts and sharing them is impactful, but living by example is the best to do. Follow what you believe in, make a difference, and show them what they could be doing instead of circling around arguments. But if you want to live by example, you need to make it known. You write? Write a book about it. You sing? Make a song about it. Show your testimony; show that people are willing to adjust their lifestyle and make sacrifices for the sake of saving our planet.
 <br><br>

Peter’s family did an excellent job living by example through their simple yet sustainable lifestyle. They impressively emit only 1/10th of greenhouses gases that an average American does. There are things that they implement that I feel like are doable by all people. For example, one thing the mother would do is walk her kids back and forth from school. I lived fairly close to my elementary school and could have done this, but we would just get picked up. We brought the idea up to my mom and dad before, just because kids like to move around, but they refused for safety reasons. Never did we consider them walking to get us. For middle school and majority of high school, we took the bus. My parents changed shifts and they were still at work by the morning and afternoon. As a result, we took the bus. Now, in college, I tend to bike and use the bus. It’s so incredibly useful, cost efficient, and beneficial for the environment. Though at times it is frustrating for when I need to grocery shop in bulk for example, it’s rewarding in other ways. Another thing discussed was using vegetable oil to operate your car. This basically recycles CO2 in a way, only putting CO2 that was already in the air versus CO2 that was fracked for. On top of that, Peter goes to restaurants and uses vegetable oil that they would have wasted otherwise. This prevents waste and especially food waste that could make up a landfill. This is also another accessible, easy solution that shows the range of possibilities. Show you care for the climate crisis by exemplifying this care to any extent.

I lived just about my whole life with a little bit less than a lot of my friends. When we'd all go out to eat, I'd sit back and watch while they ordered. If they wanted to go hit up a store for some new clothes, I'd wait while they tried on their new fits. If we were going to meet somewhere, I'd walk there in my hammy-down vans while I watched them pull up in their cars. My point in saying this is not that I'm a bum, but its that even though I had a bit less in terms of physical possession when we'd all hang out, I never had any less fun. We all laughed the same, joked the same, talked the same, and stood on the same ground. 
 <br><br>

This fits in with what Ken and "Being the Change" said about how a less materially driven life can be just as fulfilling, if not more so. You don't need all kinds of possessions to enjoy yourself. In the classes "ashes to ashes" mindset, it's important to remember that things come and go, but you'll always be with yourself, so that's the only thing you need to find peace and welness.

I really loved your response as it reminded me of my own experiences. The main idea that a less materialistic lifestyle can still be so pleasing and exciting is so true. I personally don't compare with the wealth as many of my friends, but I can't say I don't have as much fun as they do. I hope people that constantly look for the newest clothing drops, fastest cars, or biggest jewelry can experience this insatiable enjoyment of living life happily without the need for these materialistic values.

"Being the Change" really opened my eyes to the amount of impact a single individual can have on the environment and how much power they have to change it. The fact that Kalmus was able to bring down his CO2 emissions from 20 tons to 2 tons is remarkable, the effect this will have after years time, will truly impact the environment in a positive way. I enjoyed this movie because it was simple and clear, it showed that being environmentally conscious is not hard and the options are there. Options that lead to not only the benefit of our Mother Earth, but of our spiritual selves. In many cases people with less are so much more fulfilled because they are grateful for the individual things they do have and put more energy, time, and emphasis into people and experiences rather than things. I admire the effort Kalmus makes to ride his bike to work, truly practicing what he's preaching. Although this form of transportation doesn't work for everyone there are many people who could be doing it but don't. 
 <br><br>
I am from Long Beach and remember going up my dad talking to me about using the bus when I couldn't get rides and Id flinch at the idea. Slowly though I began seeing how easy, cheap and useful they are. Once public transport here is more embraced I believe it will also be supported more by the government, and expanded to be convenient and available all around California. This film showed tat the change truly does start with us, from within. Once the change is made, and you flip to the environmentally friendly way of living the grass really is greener, literally and metaphorically. We all have a choice how to pursue our lives in the future and this led me towards the way I want to pursue mine.

Utilizing public transit has always been a stigma for me for some reason. All my life I never really acknowledged how much of a privilege cars are. When my first(and last) car broke down, I realized how much better transporting myself feels. While using your own car is convenient, I always felt guilty for polluting for the sake of convenience. Public transport, though less convenient, is a way for me to calm myself and relax while on the way to go somewhere. Walking, biking, and skating are also great ways to exercise as well. 
 <br><br>
I also feel that when you take alternative forms of transportation, you open your life up to many more experiences than the isolated life that is solo driving.

I wanted to make a second comment about this week's film, "Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution". My roommate is also in this class and I woke up this morning to her watching the film. She was on the part where Paul explains how meditation has made a difference in his life and opened his mind to relating to others. It made me think about this week's reading and how Ken focused on relating to others when communicating with them about the climate crisis. He stressed not to focus on your personal actions or side of the topic and to instead wait for them to be ready to hear you and to listen to their questions and concerns. I thought this connected to Paul's views on meditation because of how it helped him to be more considerate of others and to be conscious of the "gift" of negativity. He says that we reflect our negative feelings on everyone around us. We are constantly giving away this "gift" of negativity and it then transfers its effects onto other people. It creates a chain of pain, but when you meditate, you can choose to break the chain by not giving your negativity away. Paul believes in the power of meditation and that it allows us to focus on what truly brings meaning to our lives. Similar to how we need to be conscious of others in communication, we need to be conscious of our gift of negativity. We may not need to meditate everyday, but we should live our lives with more awareness of the effects we have on the people around us and the effects our conversations have on their lives as well.

I loved this film. I thought it had a very heartfelt message and gave the climate revolution a new perspective. So often, climate change centers around the science and politics of the whole thing, but this film looked at the people whose lives were being affected by climate change. To see this suffering, the lives destroyed by something all too preventable, really makes climate change seem less about numbers and votes and more about the intangible things that make life so wonderful. I think that if I had to gain support for a cause as quick as possible, this is the style of messaging I’d use to do so. 
 <br><br>

I particularly liked the way it looked at cultures other than our own. Global Warming really does affect the whole globe. Other documentaries focus only on America (with good reason, since our contributions to the problem are the largest), but I’ve never really gotten a close look at the issue’s impact on other people, and what they’re doing to combat it. This film made me want to go join the fight with the people trying to keep big oil out of their lands.



</p><hr>

<p>

This week’s film was not my favorite, however, I did enjoy it. I think it’s true that while most people are aware of climate change they do nothing to stop it. Some people are just talk when they say they’re environmentalists; they go around talking about the issues of climate change but don’t change their lifestyle. Ken mentioned in his video the quote by Ghandi “Be the change.” This quote can apply to many things but in this case is perfect for climate change. People have to change their ways of living in order to make a real change. 
 <br><br>

This seems to be the case for Peter and his family as they take on a sustainable way of living. I was impressed by their motivation and attitudes towards living a greener life. I was amazed that they were able to live such a sustainable life in Pasadena. For transportation they relied on bikes, walking, and Peter’s vegetable oil car. The car caught me off guard as I didn’t think a car could run off vegetable oil. It’s astonishing that this family was able to reduce their emissions to 1/10 the amount of an average family.
 <br><br>

Something that really caught my ear was that Peter said the family is happier living sustainably. I would think that the kids would fight living sustainably but they seemed to appreciate and understand the value of their actions. Peter and his wife both spoke about how living them has made them happier and healthier, which led me to think about the correlation between consumerism and mental health. Peter’s phrase “The head, the hands, and the heart” says it perfectly. First, “the head” is having the mindset that climate change is real and we need to take action. Next is “the hands” which is taking action. Lastly is “the heart”, meaning you are happy and satisfied with your choices.

My reaction to "Being the Change" was a mix of happiness and overwhelm. I love the the kind hippies we see and their focus on local justice environmentally and socially. Those people are  a blend of folks that I know personally and like very much. I feel an optimism and brightness in those people even in the shadow of potential catastrophe for earth.

 <br><br>

At the same time, I was dismayed by the section that went over the car using waste oil. I can't repair and keep my own normal car in working order, so it feels like a lot to try and manage a much more complex vehicle. There were moments where I felt very distanced - like this is a scientist, and I am a writing college student, how could I figure these hacks out, when it's so much work just to keep my bathroom in functional state.

 <br><br>

It's such a hopeful film on the whole - it has cute kiddos in it, it ends on an optimistic note, and I felt relieved to see real small and sustainable community justice effort. I can't imagine though,  how much work some of Peter's life hacks must be to really pull off with a family on a regular basis.

Watching this film, I was also very happy and more optimistic about our odds against the daunting climate change. Peter Kalmus very effectively showed how the simplest of changes can reduce your carbon footprint drastically. The connections with his family presents that life is still joyful with a more minimal approach to the resources we surround ourselves with. I do agree with you that some more modern innovative methods, like the waste oil fueled car, would be fairly difficult, if not also cumbersome, to adopt into our current lifestyles. For some of us, taking these new methods and replacing elements of our lifestyles with them is not exactly feasible because of the living circumstances we are in. But the fact that we each can do our part in saving our planet with just one small change makes me feel all the more hopeful for our wellbeing and security as a species.

This film, "Being the Change," was definitely one of my favorites. It was refreshing to see a family living an environmentally conscious lifestyle without acting as though they are giving up anything or making big sacrifices. I love how Peter talks about his car, Maeby, and how he gets excited to flip the switches to change the fuel source like a little kid. It was nice to see a film about making changes for the benefit of our environment and have the information presented in such an optimistic way. Being more of an emotional thinker, many documentaries that I've seen tend to make me more depressed about the state of our environment than motivated to make change. This film, however, allowed me to envision my future, which I hope will include starting my own family, and see how I can live a sustainable lifestyle and raise my children to do the same. I loved how Peter explained his desire to raise children as future change-makers, instead of choosing to not have children at all as it increases the population. I have questioned if I want to add more people to this world myself, but seeing his perspective made me feel more assured, as well as when having children was described as a human right. Another part of the film that stuck out to me was when Peter explained how many people see today's technology as being progressive, despite it taking a major toll on the well-being of our environment. I'm sure many people would argue that our ability to supply power to our homes and vehicles and maintain many industries, such as the agriculture industry, is actually progress in our society. I find it interesting that many of the proposed solutions are cutting out what might be seen as technological progress, and I also like how Peter is able to explain this perspective as a scientist. Although his lifestyle is not necessarily minimalist, as we have seen in previous lectures, I think it is definitely a more simple lifestyle, which is shown in a positive light. I loved seeing the connections between him and his wife, as well as with their children. I think this film should be watched by more people, as it is the most accurate depiction of an American family living a sustainable lifestyle.

Like ally this film was also one of my favorites.  Peter is trying to portray that small changes from everyone can really spark a climate revolution even though people may not think so. He shows how simple things like composting, biking instead of driving and not flying can reduce our carbon footprint significantly and when a lot of us do it, big changs happen. The film shows different people like Pancho from the casa de paz, who made a change for the better and how we can do the same. I believe the film's audience are people who are concerned about the climate crisis but have no idea where to start or if they can even make these changes. Peter shows them how he turned his life around with small changes and how they can too by just simply analyzing their emissions and starting from there to reduce what they can.

 <br><br>

My general reaction was both intellectual and emotional. It was amazing to see how Peter cut his emissions by 10 times and to see his commitment to not flying. Not to mention his dedication to lower emissions through Maeby, who runs on used restaurant oil, was crazy to hear about. It makes me want to analyze my emissions and play my part in reducing them. My reaction was also emotional in the sense that his passion to create a better future for his sons resonated in me. This made me think about how I want a better and stable future for my siblings to live in. I would like future generations to enjoy the beautiful planet I got to enjoy throughout my childhood. Something new that I learned from the film is that you can use human poop for compost. I believe the film empowered me to do more for what I believe and stand for. After watching the film I felt optimistic that through small changes we can really spark a climate revolution.
<br><hr>
I am a very emotional thinker too, and I really enjoyed the way this film presented information. While many people think that we will all need to take extreme measures of minimizing and self-denial, this documentary showed a family that’s still living a very average life in a modern house, while only producing 1/10 the emissions of an average American household. The presentation of his lifestyle made it seem not only doable, but exciting, inspiring a sort of “back to nature” movement that I think many would find very appealing in our modern age. I also agree with what you said about having kids, as the prospect of starting a family one day is very exciting and really important to me. When we work to reduce our carbon emissions, it becomes more sustainable to continue having children.
 <br><br>


A really interesting point they brought up in this documentary which I hadn’t thought about was re-framing the idea of throwing things away by asking, “What is ‘away’? There’s no such thing as ‘away.’ It is planet Earth.” This is a really important concept. Especially for those transitioning into minimalism, it can feel good to clear out clutter and get rid of things, but when the garbage truck picks up our trash, it doesn’t cease to exist. Many people, myself included, hold an “out of sight, out of mind” view of garbage, but that’s simply not the case; it ends up in landfills and is still very much a problem for the earth. It’s important to think about this and be conscious consumers, striving to reduce any negative impact that we may have on Earth.

Watching this film gave me immense peace and satisfaction because I felt reassured that the change of one person is enough if we make it known that we are making change. Peter remarks that in his book he addresses the head, heart, and hands. The hands create literal change, the head allows intellectual thoughts and the heart finds the motivation and satisfaction in changing the world. Watching how Peter integrates an amazing example of be the change you want to see in the world. He amazingly integrates the lifestyle he wants to live and motivates others to be the best version he could be. I have great respect to the handiness he creates- I cannot imagine making a car that runs on vegetable oil and I am blown away by the odd things such as humane ( despite the negative stigma present in society). I cannot fathom going from 20 metric tons of carbon emissions to 2 metric tons but he indulges in the best sort of resources that is marvelous.
  <br><br>

I embrace what rob said as well, make one change a week and see how you improve. I often desire to go full environmentally conscious and then get discouraged by how difficult the immense changes can be because of how much time needed. However, watching these changes in life and balance is so important to our lives really opened my eyes to being realistic. Strive for change via actions but it is perfectly okay to make small changes and be aware.

I enjoyed this week’s film, “Being the Change” as it depicted ways people can live mindfully of the climate crisis and prioritize the environment’s wellbeing rather than just their own. Throughout this course, much of the material we’ve analyzed has been pretty depressing, seeming as though there is little we can do to make a difference to the situation. Although, this film put into perspective what many American families have the ability to do should they decide to change their lifestyle choices and habits through composting, limiting air travel, and forming other unique connections with the natural world. 
  <br><br>


However, most of the cases shown in the film were successful individuals who had the financial means to live sustainably by putting solar panels on their homes, becoming carbon neutral, or affording a waste-free lifestyle. For much of the American population, my family included, who isn't home-owning, relies on quick travel methods, wouldn't be open to freeganism, it would be a lot more difficult to adapt and shift their entire lifestyles to being carbon neutral, vegan, etc. I do understand that it isn’t realistic for the purpose of “Being the Change” to be shifting the way everyone lives as drastically as those included in the film, rather than stressing the fact that no matter how small of a change, anyone has the ability to become more sustainable which in turn will benefit the environment.

I agree that this film was helpful in providing information that is uplifting and gives us hope with this topic that is generally thought of in a negative and hopeless way. I thought it was nice to watch a film that focuses on the smaller things we can do on an individual rather than sticking to what we as the human race need to do as a whole. Individual changes are easier to commit to and will provide us with more success as we change our lifestyles to ensure our actions are more sustainable and less harmful to the environment. I also agree that only the financially privileged would be able to make these changes without much impact on their security. What they need to do, to ensure everyone has access to these less-impactful lifestyle choices, is to focus on making these goals easier to attain. Without everyone on the same page, we cannot make the impactful changes that will preserve our planet for generations to come.

Going into this movie, I wasn’t expecting for it to be so heartwarming. Unlike many of the other documentaries we have seen, there were no difficult facts, disturbing footage, or ominous voiceover. Instead, the movie feels hopeful and it really connected to me. One reason may be that it showed my hometown, Oakland! The topics highlighted in this clip, like community gardens and restorative justice, are really popular there. It's what I grew up on and it makes me feel proud of my city. Additionally, I was shocked to see how much time was meditation and mindfulness. I agreed deeply with Peter’s analysis of how meditation allows us to process our emotions, flush the negativity, and engage in more positive relationships.
   <br><br>
Overall, I think many of the messages in this movie should be taken to heart. If everyone were to focus on bettering their lives through meditation, community engagement and action, and innovative living, our society would look so much different. I think we would live healthier, happy lives this way! Sometimes, it's hard for me to picture what it would really be like to change, on a fundamental level, my life to be more sustainable. However, this movie was able to paint a clear picture for me. I think if we were all able to embody Peter Kalmus’s message of taking small action and following good, we could have hope for the future

I really respect and admire Peter Kalmus' life and dedication to his passion of environmentalism. I feel like his life can be somewhat a reflection of humanity and the state of the globe itself. I love how he places a lot of importance on meditation and living by being more in touch with the earth. 
   <br><br>
He is a great example of literally being the change he wants to see in the world, and obviously he is very inspiring to others because he lives this way.
   <br><br>
With all the knowledge that Peter has, I really admire how he lives a life on the "middle ground," such as how he decided to have children although he believes it may be better not to in terms of world overpopulation. Personally, I find myself living the middle road a lot. There is not one perfect, ideal life. There is balance in being. For example, with my diet, I eat environmentally consciously and ideally vegan, but there are some times where I may have some meat just due to situations and circumstances - maybe a great host cooked an amazing dinner - I find myself in so that I may encounter life fully. I also admire Peter's creativeness and ingenuity with his car, Maeby, that runs on vegetable oil. By fully embracing his life and living the way he does he shows that a peaceful coexistence with the natural world is attainable, and we can break away from the harmful habits of our current society to do what is best not only for the planet, but ourselves as human beings as well.

Tomorrow was so unlike any of the other films that we have watched and I loved it. Most of the other films only focused on the environment and its endangerment as a contributor to climate change and the poor state of the world today. Tomorrow, on the other hand, looks at a myriad of aspects of society (agriculture, education, democracy, energy, economy) that currently don't work as well as they could to benefit people and the planet. This aspect of the film was so interesting to me because I have never thought of economy or democracy as being things that could be used to better the planet, or really as having any environmental impact at all honestly. Something else I really enjoyed about this film was that it highlighted different groups and societies that have already changed their ways to improve the lives of their people and the earth, such as the way they grow food or the way their monetary system functions or the way they teach the next generation. 
   <br><br>
Tomorrow finally pinpoints the real issues that hurt our environment and our world as a whole, and they are global issues every country has experienced. The film shows us that the fight for a better world does not just lie in the hands of a few very powerful or very wealthy people, real solutions come when everyone's voice is heard and when everyone gets a chance to express their concerns and act upon them. This film demonstrates to its viewers that being more connected to one another and promoting diversity and inclusivity in everything we do can have immense positive changes in many aspects of our lives on this earth, ideas that have long been overlooked by our political and economic leaders.

In the film “Being the change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution”, Peter Kalmus stated out the concept of 3 “H”-head, hand and heart. It means that we have to first realize the damage of climate change and start to fight for our future. Finally, we need to realize, from our moral principle, that this is our mission to accomplish the goal of reducing carbon emission. 
   <br><br>
Step 1 may have started at my very young age. The Earth Day may be the one that taught me the concept of global warming. At this quarter, taking Climate Crisis really helps me finished straight through the step 2 and step 3. At step 2, I told my parents not to buy another car just for their convenience or at least buy an electric one. Both of them are professors who are supposed to be the people always follow up the latest trend of science. To my surprise, it took me an awful lot of effort just to convince the negative effect of climate change. At my step 3, I felt it was my responsibility to vote for Democrats like Bernie Sanders who takes the Green New Deal into consideration. I mean, if I am ever qualified to vote.

“Being the Change” is a really fascinating documentary. It mainly focus on how personal action contribute to protecting the environment. I used to believe that personal actions are not so important, compared with being a political activism. After watching this film, I just realize that it is the personal action that finally leads to becoming a vanguard vanguard of climate change. Peter’s family have accepted higher education, and their lifestyles are inspiring. They live in a typical two parents two children family with a dog, and using their knowledge to live in a green lifestyle. Superficially, Peter’s family looks not so environmental friendly: they have two children, live in a big house, get pets, and own cars.However, as the film keeps going I was surprised by how they take use of wasted vegetable oil to drive their cars. When it burns, Vegetable-based fuel emits cleaner and non-toxic gases, and they are renewable energy source. Peter’s creative and friendly ideas will influentially affect his children and neighborhood, as well as people who watch this documentary. He is a successful environmental activist that persuades others to protect their community. His has answered the question asked before:”Personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active. Which matters more.” Now the answer becomes obvious: all of them are important, and are complement to each other.

I agree with your idea. I once thought that Government actions make more changes than individual actions. Though I will continue living in an environmentally friendly lifestyle, such as avoid driving or consuming unnecessary products, I still believe that it is less effective compared with political actions, such as establish a law to limit the beef and fossil fuel industries. However, after watching the documentary "Being the Change", I realized that personal movement is equally important as a political one. Because when each small action union together, the power is huge enough to influence the country or even the world. Imagine if someone starts the movement and tons of people follow. It will be breaking news and more and more people will see and follow it. If you don't have the power to charge the country, then follow the protecting environment movement is the best choice since it will finally become a huge revolution.

I don’t know what it was but the documentary had a home-y, vintage feel to it, so much so that I had to google when it was made because the camerawork seemed like it was out of the 80s or something. Then I found out it was from PBS from 2018, just showing how recent it all is, but more so, how optimistic everything is turning out be. It’s all at a slow pace though, a pace that needs to be quickened alongside the general public. One of the more interesting things was the car that ran on vegetable oil that Peter Klamus made. I didn’t even know that was a thing! I agreed on the whole notion that we all believe that technology is supposed to solve our problems, but as Peter puts it, it just creates more problems but we already knew this as with the whole Tesla situation Ken explained earlier. I have to admit though, that one segment of the guy dumpster diving and taking a bite was a bit extreme but I get it, it was to prove the point of perfectly good food to be thrown away. One of the things I’ll take away from this film is how everyone can turn this into a message expressed through art, like Peter expressed, whether you’re a writer or artist or anything, it’s something we can all express. The film even showed this through the guy who expressed how he was writing a play about climate change. That’s something interesting I’d go and see.

In the film Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, I thought there was an intriguing idea raised by Peter of how initially is the head then from that the hands and afterward at long last the heart. He clarifies that the head thinks about the effect of one activity and the effect of the other activity. The head helps think and choose and has a scholarly understanding. With regards to the hands, they help you really stuff. Diminish had the option to keep up his family's way of life while as yet figuring out how to lessen his carbon impression to 1/10th that of a normal American. While he couldn't totally dispense with donors, for example, his vehicle, he had the option to figure out how to make it all the more earth well disposed by changing over its fuel and decreasing its utilization by depending more on biking and strolling. Changing over the vehicle to run on vegetable oil works makes the vehicle effective as well as addresses the issue of nourishment squander as it repurposes what might some way or another be discarded. In any case, the less noteworthy changes can at present add to the master plan if a bigger number of individuals can actualize them. Perhaps we as a whole could surrender a portion of our things while as yet having the option to keep some with conditions that will profit the planet while as yet working in the manner for you.

I truly enjoyed “Being the Change” because Kalmus showed a whole new perspective on the environment than the previous documentaries we have watched. Instead of focussing on the problems of the earth and how humans are not making any change, he introduced a positive and enlightening film that presented individuals ways in which we can create a healthy lifestyle for ourselves and the environment. Furthermore, Kalmus talked about how he started to make changes in his lifestyles that have helped our earth. He explained how his head, hands, and heart made him find a new direction in life. His head represents thinking about current problems, his hands focused on taking action while his heart found meaning in the things he was doing. He is very intelligent, confident, and enthusiastic throughout the whole film. He lives a very natural and healthy lifestyle by growing his own crops and saving energy. He also uses vegetable oil to run his car and uses his bicycle as transportation which I find is an extremely useful way to help pollution. This documentary has influenced me to start making a change in my diet by not consuming any meat twice a week. I also perceived meditation differently as the film revealed how it can help me connect to myself, the role I play on the planet and the environment surrounding me. Additionally, I truly enjoyed all of the scenery and nature this documentary presented and the multiple perspectives the interviewees had on the environment. I would completely recommend inspirational and educational film to show my friends and family how we can take action in order to live a happier and more satisfying life.

By watching the film “Being The Change,” I was impressed by Peter about how he chose to live his life. It may take lots of effort for people to start the change, but after we get used to this sustainable style of living, we may personally feel happier and fulfill. When he mentioned his experience with meditation, it relates to my personal feeling. I start doing meditation just a few months ago. Every morning when I weak up I would meditate for a while then starts my day. I think it helps me to focus on the most essential thing in my life and feel more grateful for what I have. It improves my awareness of how I see myself and my relation to the world around me. 
   <br><br>

With the topic we discussed in class, it all makes me rethink what the dream life I want to live in the future is. I feel like I already have too much then what I need. It makes me realize that I am not using the resources in a better way and take it for granted. I strongly agree being the change is the most impactful thing we could do individually if we want to see the difference we should be the change.

I was impressed as well by how Peter lives his life with his family. People are naturally very resistant to change, but once you make the change it can be very lasting and impact a great deal of other people when they see it is possible to be satisfied and happy living a life with just a lot less stuff. I recently have begun doing meditation as well coincidentally and found it contributes a great deal to my happiness and overall daily satisfaction as I am more grateful for what I have.
   <br><br>


I consider often as well what I actually want out of my future and it seems to change the more I'm educated about what the future might look like. My dream life certainly consists of less material things and more relationships and experiences, but I was never that hard sold on a lot of material things anyway.

It was very interesting watching Peter’s journey from living in NYC to moving to California, and at the same time becoming more environmentally aware. I did notice how most of the individuals in the film were highly educated and lived middle to upper class lives that allowed them to make changes to reduce their CO2 emissions. Peter works at JPL and Caltech which are both very prestigious institutions and his friends were getting their PhD in very technical subjects. This leads me to believe that more educated individuals become the more they are aware of the effects of anthropogenically caused climate change. Peter was educated and aware of changes he can make such as maintaining his vegetable oil run car and farming in his own yard. Like we learned earlier in class just by eliminating his use of flights he was able to cut down significantly on his individual CO2 emissions. It was nice to see a family of 4 living comfortably while also living a climate friendly lifestyle.

I loved the film "Being the Change" because it opened my eyes up to new possibilities concerning an individual's contribution to climate change. It's so inspiring to see that someone like Peter is able to carve this pathway for people and wants to share his story with the world, which is something he strongly emphasizes in his film. So, if people want to change the world for the better, they need to let the world know that they're changing it. Two things really caught my attention that were so feasible and possible but something I'd never thought of. The first was his vegetable oil powered car; this is a concept that takes reusing to a whole new level in my opinion. I didn't even know that you could power a car off of waste vegetable oil alone, and it makes me wonder how many different uses you actually have with something like vegetable oil (cooking, fuel, etc.) The second was the idea of composting from human waste. It seemed strange to me at first, but then I realized how common it was that human waste just gets flushed away all over the world, and usually it can actually lead to negative impacts on individual's water cleanliness and overall wellbeing of their environment. Peter's method doesn't require fancy technology and lots of money; it just takes some awareness and making use of what you have and its multi functionality. I don't have the kind of money to invest in eco-friendly technology, but I can do many small things that are affordable and sometimes even free to contribute, which is a very comforting feeling.

This week's film, "Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution", had many inspiring moments and contained several examples of what we have been discussing through this course. The main thing I would like to discuss about this film is its main character Peter and his family. Their lifestyle, too many, may seem unusual or out of the ordinary, as in fact it is. They produce their own energy at home, drive a grease powered car named "Maeby", and study the practice of meditation regularly. Compared to the lifestyle of the average American, living in our consumer driven world, Peter and his family are different. Even still, I think it is very important that our population is exposed to this kind of lifestyle and that we learn to understand the benefits of living a similar one. Recently, we have been discussing the importance of systemic change in our government through voting; putting people in office who have the future of our planet in the forefront of their plans. I do agree that this is what it is going to take to save our planet, but I also agree with the way that Peter explained his solution to the issue. During an interview with a fellow colleague, Peter and his friend were debating the idea of starting small and then building. They explained this in a way of individuals (starting small) making lifestyle changes and then ultimately pushing political leaders and our nation as a whole to do the same (build). As more of us start to shift our way of living and/or perspectives on the climate crisis, we will begin sort of a grassroots movement. We are capable of shifting our culture by taking personal action and inspiring others around us to do the same. Then, we build awareness, expanding our issue even further and just as we see now with the creation of the GND, we demand large scale change. I agree with Peter: "The personal changes are connected to the large-scale ones." Also, as soon as our environmental leaders start to "walk the walk", we will have more people open and willing to make these changes. We need people in office who will lead by example, not those who just say one thing and do another. This is why I believe it is important for us to see examples of an environmental conscious life and people actually taking steps towards reducing their GHG emissions. This makes us feel more comfortable with the potential changes our society is going to have to face and excited about how beneficial this will be in the long run. Therefore, not only was this film inspiring, but it was revolutionary.

The film “ Being the Change” was a very informative film that discusses Peter’s eco friendly environment lifestyle. I found it amazing that Peter was able to successfully make changes in his life without major resistance. I think that the film is a good example of the implementation of new routines and some changes, but nothing too different. Realistically getting people to give up long standing materialism and capitalism will be a bit difficult, but not impossible. I would definitely say that seeing the dedication 
   <br><br>
Peter showed to living an eco friendly life despite the obstacles that daily life brings such as the big convenience of getting to places especially far in a timely manner, is very encouraging to the audience including myself to take action. I think it is crucial to have examples of people/families being sustained through very minimal  greenhouse emission because leading by exapmle is very important I think.

I thought the film, “Being the Change” was really interesting and different from previous ones we have watched. I really appreciated that they intertwined self-peace with living sustainability. There is definitely a connection between meditation, living peacefully with the earth, and being content with yourself. I thought it was particularly interesting that they focused on everyday fixes and not on expensive technology. For someone who grew up in suburban LA, this gave me hope that fixing climate change is possible for everyone, not just the rich. I also thought their focus on zero waste was great and really important. Hearing that 50 million Americans are food insecure and yet, we produce enough for two Americas was a wakeup call. We waste significant amounts, contributing to food insecurity as well as the climate crisis. This movie brought awareness that fixing the climate crisis is a multi-dimensional problem. 
   <br><br>

While I thought the movie was very insightful and motivating, I struggled with how realistic it truly is. They had a composting station and a garden in their backyard, along with a unique waste system. They drove a vegetable oil powered car and biked most places. While all of this sounds great and very environmentally friendly, I am not sure if the average family in America could do the same. The adults were both very educated and had years of experience with science and fixing old items. The father was a scientist and knew how to manufacture all of this. While I desperately want to find a solution, I am not sure if all of this is very applicable. I definitely believe parts are, such as biking and growing gardens. I think we can take this and implement it into our own lives, slowly making a difference.

 I am happy to see someone brought up your latter point. I too found myself asking this same question. In terms of my own life, I would love to say I could fully commit myself to such practices and be a proponent for helping combat the climate crisis. But as I have learned more and gone through this class, I am struggling with the fact that I am not as 'green' as I once pictured. Finding out more about the subtleties and complex details of carbon footprints has allowed me to see that I have been nonsensical about my place in combatting this issue. Luckily, through the awareness of this class and adding new tools to my environmental toolbox, I think I am getting better and starting to look at the climate crisis in a new light. But back to your point, do I think that I, let alone most families who have to constantly deal with the hustle and bustle of work, family, and everything in between would be able to fully commit myself to this lifestyle. I am not going to indefinitely say yes or no, because I know it depends on the family. But I will say, that I do not think this strong level of commitment could be expected from everyone. I know this movie was created to be a source of inspiration, ingenuity, and family centered goals, but I agree that it did falter, at least slightly, on making this lifestyle look applicable

Being the change sets itself apart from other film productions with the same occurring theme by focusing on the ways that the common individual can make a change instead of putting an emphasis on the issues the climate crisis has created and continues to create. It explores the many different steps that an individual can take to potentially make their  households more environmentally friendly by altering their usual habits. For example, one can simply cut their carbon footprint by walking and/or biking to work instead of driving a car, using humaneur for food production, or by focusing on gathering foods that supermarkets and restaurants are going to throw away instead of purchasing it and contributing to landfill waste. This in turn makes the film unique because unlike other films, it creates a sense of hope among a local and greater community instead of making the audience feel largely pessimistic and as if their contributions won’t be helpful at all.
    <br><br>

This film has been most likely produced to appeal to the general public and not just specifically to the people who are conscious of the climate crisis. One way that the producers were able to successfully captivate the attention of the audience was by including new and refreshing topics that highlight the significance of life, such as the practice of meditation that supposedly relaxes one’s soul and as Kalmus touches upon in the first half of film, helps one come to terms with living a short life. This part of the documentary in particular makes people want to embrace the life they are living instead of taking it for granted, hence possibly creating a feeling of urgency among the audience and thus making them more inclined to take action against the climate crisis. 
   <br><br>
My general reaction to the film was more so intellectual than emotional. By demonstrating the steps that Kalmus and Greenfield take to immensely reduce their carbon print, it gives me a better idea of what I can do to contribute to a much healthier environment. I would definitely recommend this film to a friend so that they too would feel empowered to take initiative in their households/community to help suppress the climate crisis.

In this week’s documentary, Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, there were a few things that stood out to me but what stood out to me the most was the Carbon Fee and Dividend. There were three main things about the Carbon fee that I thought made it sound like a good idea. First the step that the government has to do is to place a fee on fossil fuels at the mine, well or point of entry. Step two is to return the fees received back to the U.S household (minus the admin costs). The final step is to, “take measures to prevent business relocation out of the U.S.” . This final step is the key to regulate businesses and how much carbon they reduce. If we have a business production here in the U.S. we can regulate how much carbon they emit and we don’t pollute the rest of the world. This insures that we are not the ones polluting their water supply. 
   <br><br>

Kalmus Lives the life that Professor Ken tells us to live but honestly I think it still seems out of reach like driving a car that runs on used cooking oil. Even Kalmus thinks that it is not the best because he named it Maeby, like maybe it will get there and maybe it will not. He also uses his own feces as a manure for the plants that he grows. I don’t know if it is just me but I don’t want to be doing that. It sounds like something that came out of the movie the martian.

Having lived near the very large city of Chicago for most of my life, while admittedly living in a suburb, I know first hand what a lot of boomers did not seem to realize: suburbs are so gross. The plains of Illinois are beautiful!! Rolling prairies and fields that go on for miles!! You know what isn't pretty: the houses and McDonalds that divide up those prairies. It seems mostly lost on people that building things near beautiful places makes those places less beautiful: trust me, it does. Cities on the other hand are amazing: lots to do, lots to see, environmentally friendly and perfect if you wanted to get close with your family. But what people want to do is ruin the beauty around cities for no other reason than to “have some space”. This, for most people who grew up in similar neighborhoods then mine, means simply living in a subdivision owned by a property company, where the mortgage on your house ruins your life. So why do people still live in the suburbs? Because, like everything else in our economy, it was sold to people. 
    <br><br>
People didn't just buy the big house they could not afford. They bought the quiet neighborhood with room for kids to run around--where the city failed to provide for these basic needs, the answer was always to get up and move to a place that does not want humans in it. People didn't just buy the big yard, they bought the 45 minute commute in traffic on highways that were designed for one neighborhood to get to the city: not an entire exodus of population movement to occur every single day at around 5pm. Cities are nice because we made them nice. Suburbs suck because we didn't make them at all: we just kind of let them happen.

I enjoyed watching the film “Being the Change” and felt like it successfully communicated its argument. Seeing real people actually doing so much to help, rather than people sitting there telling us what we all could be doing, was very inspiring. All of the individual stories in this film truly made me feel like I could be doing so much more, and it made me admire all of the people who are making these changes. Showing these people, including Peter Kalmus and his family or the people of “Casa de Paz,” was very effective because it shows the viewers specific examples of what we can be doing to help and shows that it really is possible because all of these people are doing it. I feel like this has been one of my favorite films in this class because even though it was very informative about the climate crisis, it still managed to inspire me rather than make me feel absolutely useless.

I agree with you, this film really made me rethink the choices I have made in order to reduce my emissions and made me feel like there is so much more that I could do to help the climate crisis. “Being the Change” is an informative and interesting documentary that demonstrates how Peter Kalmus was able to reduce his emissions by a large amount (from 20 to 2 tons) by utilizing many different methods such as using a car powered by grease, growing our own produce, and eating a more plant based diet. Throughout the film, I was interested in Peter’s approach to this lifestyle especially since he has kids and a family. I liked how he made changes to his lifestyle that weren’t too drastic and seemed reasonable compared to other climate activists. I especially liked the “repair cafe” in Pasadena in which people took their broken tools to get fixed. In this case as well as in the Kalmus family, the audience is shown that we don’t need to buy new shiny things to be happy, repairing tools can make not only the customer as well as the technician happy. By reducing the need to buy new things, we can not only save money, but we can also reduce our carbon footprint.

Tomorrow wasn't my favorite film out of all the ones we have watched this quarter so far, but I liked that the filmmakers didn't spend a ton of time trying to convince you of problems in the world but simply excepted them as facts and then went on to present solutions.  It was a nice refreshment to watch a film that didn't seem super pessimistic and only focus on the negative aspects of climate change but instead focused on possible solutions to the problems that we are facing.  I liked that they grouped the solutions into 5 different categories.  It was also cool to see that they showed a variety of solutions-both big and small.  I think my favorite part of the film was seeing Copenhagens move to more renewable energy, but I also think that it would be hard for the whole world to make such a big transition.  The composting that San Francisco is implementing is also super interesting to me.  I liked that the film highlighted how communities are connecting to make changes towards a more sustainable future, and I think that it did a really good job introducing a variety of new ways to help communities reconnect with the environment.  I think that it would be a little hard to fully implement these solutions around the world, but it gives me hope to see how much has already been done, and what more can be done in the future.

I agree with what you said about the film being direct. It effectively explains the critical situation we are in and provides obtainable solutions to the problem. Among these solutions is changing the way we eat.  In the US, food travels about 1,500 miles on average leaving a tremendous impact on the environment, so urban farming seems like a feasible plan. Malik, Co-manager of D-Town Farm explains “there’s a lot of romanticism of urban agriculture” because people see it as “the new sexy thing,” but it’s “detached from the reality of the work.” This made me think about how if so many people refuse to stop eating meat because it’s “too hard,” then they will absolutely dismiss the idea of planting your own food too. I do agree with you, though, that it’s a great way to help communities reconnect with the environment and one another, all while living a sustainable lifestyle.

While watching the film Being the Change, I was interested to see someone with such a technology-based major in college to be straying away from technology due to climate change. It goes to show that just because you may enjoy technology or even work in the field of technology, you can still advocate for a life with less technology at least in the sense of the technology not needed. What attracted most of my attention in this film was the fact that all of this was happening in Pasadena because my hometown is just a few miles from there. It shocked me that I have never heard of some of the groups and places expressed in the film. I really enjoyed hearing about Transition Pasadena and Repair Cafe Pasadena because both were based on volunteer work to power the entire thing. Being based on volunteer work thus allows these groups to be available to all people no matter what their economic or class status may be. Additionally, hearing how students from Caltech and other colleges would come to the Repair Cafe made me so happy because it was a win-win-win situation in the way that citizens would get their items fixed, we would have less electronic waste, and students would get to test their skills when trying to fix these items.
   <br><br>
Seeing how Peter also changed his life to helping these groups but also change his own life was nice to see. Often times we are told to change our lifestyles but are never shown how to do it or how it affects people and this film showed those missing pieces. Seeing how he slowly changed his life and integrated it even to his family’s lifestyles was eye-opening to see how you can live in a balanced life where you can still have technology in your life while still being climate and planet-friendly was nice. Peter still lived in a decent-sized home but switched their transportation to mainly bicycling. In addition, they used their car Maeby which was cool to see it running off of vegetable oils that would have gone to waste at local restaurants if Peter was not collecting it. Overall, seeing how making a balance gave me hope that maybe we all could give up some of our things while still being able to keep some with conditions that will benefit the planet while still functioning in the way for you.

It honestly reminded me of the documentary about minimalism in a sense. It goes to show that not ever materialistic item is absolutely necessary in our lives. Actually, I think this documentary tied in a lot of things we’ve been talking about recently. Again, I am reminded that change is possible and that I can make an effort to make alterations in my diet and overall consumer habits. I like your emphasis on how we’re always told to change our habits but not actually shown how. I think even someone going through a list of how to change your lifestyle isn’t enough because many people need something to visualize. Some things may seem far fetched to people and they’re like “I’d never be able to get rid of technology!” And then you can show them this film, which has someone who literally loves learning about the field of technology and can still stray away from it in their own personal life, and they’re more likely to be like “ok, maybe it is possible.”

We definitely need more Repair Cafes (or something similar)! Even though I live rather close to Pasadena, I know nothing about that area and had no idea about their efforts of living more substantially. We really need to work on creating the types of volunteer opportunities they offer all around the states because I see so many people immediately getting rid of old technology just because it needs repair. My dad shattered his phone screen and was going to get a new one until we found a good repair place. If we made it a little easier, I think people would save a lot more time and, most importantly, waste.

I totally feel the same way after I watched this documentary. When whenever we say we can't help make changes on climate crisis or our actions are not strong enough to help make a changes to the current situation, we are just giving excuses or we simply don't want to admit the fact that this is actually happening. People are afraid because changes on relying on technology will impact our lives so much and its gonna make our lives less easier and less convenient. 
   <br><br>


But as we saw from this documentary, we see a possible way that we can still have a nice suburban life, relying on less technology, while still  having a happy life and doing something good to our planet. It is true, as someone who once study technology based major are willing to make such a change from staying away from more use of technology.However, I think it is because he studied such major before, he knows the impacts technology will bring to us. He also know how important technology  is for us to live with but he also show a possibility that we don't actually to have and consume everything to maintain a good lives. A balance between environment , lives and technology are important and it is definitely achievable and possible.
   <br><br>


What he said let me rethink about what live actually is. To live a happy life is actually simple, to have enough to live with e.g to eat and to wear. Have extra things which it doesn't make our lives so much better doesn't help making our live more meaningful but instead, bring a huge impact to our planet because of over consumption. 

   <br><br>

To solve climate change it not just to see the problem but we need to understand it, to take action to solve it. his documentary gave me hope that it is very doable for most of us to make a change to our lives and making our planet a sustainable one.

Similarly to you, I was intrigued by "Being the Change" because of Peter’s technological background coupled with his newfound interest in environmental conservation and sustainability. I found the entire film to be very inspiring overall in how we were shown all the steps that must be taken to make these small changes in our everyday lives. Then came the shocking information, that due to these minor changes, Peter and his family were able to cut down their carbon footprint to 1/10th what the average American emits! It was results such as this that made this film all the more convincing and prompted me to make similar changes in my life.
   <br><br>


What I found most interesting about the film, however, was the fact that Peter’s whole family participated in this change. I believe that this is a prime example of what Ken has been talking about: personal changes leading to collective action. As I lived in a four person household most of my life, I have found that it is very easy to become a part of a family member’s routine, mainly because of our proximity. For example, when my sister decided to become vegetarian, she began to shop for vegetarian foods and because these foods were brought into the house, I would end up eating them as well, despite not committing to the vegetarian lifestyle. This film showed a very similar situation and gives me hope that in the future, if at least one family member is environmentally conscious, it might be enough to transfer sustainable actions to other family members too.

I was thinking of some of the same things while watching the documentary! When I heard that Peter received his PhD in something so highly scientific and technology-based, I thought the documentary was going to focus on how technology can assist us in facing the climate crisis. Knowing Ken and his true comments about how cultural change will be what can solve this crisis, not technological invention and adoption, I was a bit surprised. Seeing that the documentary focused on personal lifestyle changes and collective community changes, everything made much more sense. However, I think it was a wise choice of the filmmaker to include Peter's scientific and tech oological credibility in a film that focused on the cultural changes an individual and a community can make to help with the climate crisis. At some points in the film, especially when Peter went into his transformative journey with meditation, it seemed as if making lifestyle changes because of climate change seemed like something only California hippies do, and those actions where therefore inaccessible to most people who want to live a more typical life. Knowing that Peter went to grad school for science and works at JPL made cultural changes more accessible to an entirely new audience that may never try meditation because they think it is weird or too different from what they are comfortable doing. 
   <br><br>
I also appreciated how the film showed a completely normal community making their lives better by implementing eco-friendly cultural changes into their lives. This opened up such changes to many more communities since more people are able to relate to different members of an entire community than just one man and his immediate family.



<br><hr>


I also found it interesting to see someone with a technology based major who understands that technology is the biggest issue of climate change. Many of my peers believe that climate change is a very real issue and that our only hope to combat climate change is through technology. This is why many choose to not to take personal action and rely on inventions to fix the issue. However, at least Peter understands that technology is not the solution, being the change is. We need more people in the world who have the mindset like Peter and the other people in the documentary. Innovators like the people who run Transition Pasadena and Repair Cafe are the ideas we need in order to advance towards lowering the community carbon footprint. Volunteers who help out with these programs are the people who will help inspire others to make a change. There need to be more inventions towards promoting an ecologically friendly lifestyle, such as labels on food marking the carbon footprint. 
   <br><br>

What I found great was how Peter and his partner were teaching their kids good environmental habits. I think this goes to show how people are beginning to do more and more about the climate crisis as generations go on, especially if parents continue to teach their children ecologically friendly habits. Many people think that they have to make extreme lifestyle changes in order to be more ecofriendly. However, Peters documentary shows that you can make a slow lifestyle change even with children and reduce your footprint by 1/10th of the average American. I think this film can be inspiring to many Americans. However, I don’t think that it covered enough statistics to be fully convincing for many. This was actually my least favorite documentary because I think it showed unrealistic expectations. Sure, it is an easy switch to bike to school, but switching to a car that runs off of vegetable oil or using “”humanure” isn’t an easy or practical switch for many Americans. Many people would find eating waste or using humanure gross. Therefore, I think it may not be as convincing to many people and isn't the best way of displaying an eco friendly family.

I am in 100% percent agreement with your comment as to how surprising that Peter who is in a field that has a heavy presence in technology today has been able to stray away from so much technology is amazing. Not only that but like you I am from a few miles from Pasadena, therefore because this film took place so close to home I was instantly drawn to it. I was also surprised to learn that all of these organizations and events happen so close to home and I have never heard  of them until watching this film. 
   <br><br>
 The coolest part of this film to me was his car maebel that ran on vegetable oil. This was a whole new concept that I had never heard of so I was instantly drawn to it and even googled it to learn more about myself. This a really unique innovation that is very sustainable and allowed Peter to travel to some places like normal with virtually no fossil fuel emissions. Not only that but the fact that Peter had switched to a lifestyle that was so sustainable, so close to home made me realize the practicality of his choice in lifestyle. This was a cool film for me personally.





<br><hr>

I also thought it was nice to see how Peter changed his lifestyle. It is important to have people out there who are willing to make changes to show our society that it is possible. His story served as a source of inspiration. As you mentioned, something as simple as giving up some of our things can benefit the planet. I thought the film emphasized the importance of community and making a change one step at a time. I thought this was very important as one of them in the film mentioned that it all starts with one heart, one house, and one block at a time.




<br><hr>


I also was surprised because I would expect someone with Peter's education and career background to advocate for technological solutions to climate change, rather than personal lifestyle changes. There are certainly those who believe in the power of technology to fix this crisis for us and eliminate the consequences of decades of emissions. I know this is a topic that has come up again and again but I believe it is worth addressing because this will likely be one of the biggest debates around the climate crisis in the future. Technological advancements and solutions are seen as the future. We live in the era of Elon Musks and Apple and Amazon shops where robot/AI takeovers of society seems possible to some enthusiasts. We can do amazing things, but even if we had the technology to suck all of the carbon out of the atmosphere and somehow get rid of or sequester it safely, I would say we should avoid doing so and stick to making proactive changes in behavior. The human tendency to look to technology and innovation as a bandaid for all of our irresponsible actions and resulting problems is a HUGE and dangerous flaw. Let's say we "fix" the climate crisis with carbon-sequestering machines and avoid impending catastrophe. There will always be another problem, a more complex one that comes along, ESPECIALLY because we will have and already have convinced ourselves that the effects of our actions can be mitigated and we don't need to take personal responsibility for anything. And if not this crisis, then the next thing that threatens to end humanity as we know it actually will. Further, the idea of technology being the "saving grace" feeds into and also reinforces the problematic pillars of capitalism, inequality, materialism, etc. In our current political-economic system, just imagine how this technological solution would play out. No doubt, the tech design would be spearheaded by some big shot from a privileged country like the U.S., leading to political plays and problems depending on its origin, making them an individual of (if not already) massive wealth and influence -- since human capital and innovation in this system is treated the way it is -- ending up with production being outsourced to poorer countries at their expense and exploitation of their resources. So sure the carbon might be reduced but does anything really change? Who would pay for this miracle solution and would it be proportionate to the contributors to the problem in the first place? History tells me no. No one suffers, no systems of oppression or inequality are reinforced when people decide to take individual action and make lifestyle changes like Peter and his family did. When the responsibility and power for change is shifted and shared among all peoples rather than one tech designer, government, or production company, there is NOTHING but positive effects.

I agree with you completely, I feel like it was such a heartwarming and wholesome documentary that didn’t stringently focus on you need to do this and you need to do that, without showing us how these changes will actually impact our lives. This documentary, however, does that beautifully, it does not just tell us what we need to do and why we need to do it and how it will help the environment, but it also shows us what our lives could look like, with biking to school and using vegetable oil fueled cars (which was absolutely amazing by the way). What Peter said is true! People who do these environmentally friendly things ARE happier because they have more meaning in their lives. They do not rely on their social status or material things to dictate their happiness, instead, they cherish the moments in life and are truly present in the moment. I always use to find meditation fascinating and honestly thought that I myself do my own form of mild meditation (daydreaming at any time, on any day), and find it brings peace and creativity in life. 
   <br><br>

Another thing that really struck me was how Peter and a few other scientists in the film were talking about how yes you might think as an individual what good am I going to do by myself if I turn Vegan, or if I move to an electric car, or if I get a big house, I'm ashamed to admit it but that has been my mentality for the past half decade or so, when I really became aware of the dangers of climate change. But when Peter said something along the lines of, if 1 person decides not to fly, then yes the plane will still fly, but with one less passenger, which in hindsight won't decrease CO2 emissions by much, or by anything really. But, If 300 people decide not to fly then that is one less plane in the sky, and if 3000 people decide not to fly, that’s 100 planes that won't be flying, therefore less Greenhouse gas emissions. This is exactly the mentality that everyone that drops, because I can guarantee that there are minimum millions of people that think like me, they want to make a difference, but they things that they are required to do are extremely drastic changes to their lives and so if they do wanna make that change, they wanna ensure that something good comes of it. That they actually made a difference. 
   <br><br>

One thing I found extremely interesting, and honestly slightly humorous (maybe even disgusting) was the humanure project. I thought that it was quite far fetched and a bit extra at first, but the more I listened the more I understood the importance of this. Years ago, before civilization, humans lived among nature, and they certainly did not have high class heated and self flushing toilets. They just went on the ground and that was nature’s source of natural fertilizer. Now, I am willing to give up and try many things to try and reduce the greenhouse global emissions, but I apologize in advance Ken I think humanure is just something I cannot get behind. I value my clean toilets with flushing systems and toilet rolls too much to get behind the pope of poop’s book.

This week's readings seem to be more on the optimistic side of the spectrum. They are showing us examples of how to make a contribution, they are showing us how people today are making a difference; they are giving us hope. I know many of my classmates prefer these type of readings as it gives them more hope to fight for our future. I agree with many of the points that are mentioned and the different options that are offered. As someone who struggles to talk about climate change with my family, this type of reading would help to promote various changes we can make to our lifestyles. They always complain about how I scare them instead of giving them hope, so I believe this type of content is more beneficial for the broader masses.

I felt the same way while watching “Being the Change”, as it turned out to definitely be one of my favorites from this class. As you said, it was compelling and refreshing to witness someone with a heavily established background, interest, and investment in general technology, uproot their lifestyle and gear it towards environmentalism and minimalism. From this, I have a newfound sense of hope because although many of us inevitably have futures strongly invested or based around technology (stem, business, etc), I think that most of us will use our knowledge and understanding of technology’s impact and influence for the better. I also really admire the Repair Cafes and i think there needs to be more access to services similar to them. 
   <br><br>


Ultimately, I feel like the film encouraged and facilitated actions that individuals can actualize in their own lives. I especially admire the film's interplay with spirituality, effectively incorporating its perspective with the environment. In the future, I hope to find a new balance with my familiar lifestyle and introduce new behaviors that will benefit the planet and the environment I live in.

When I was watching the beginning of  the film “Being the Change”, I was a little confused on how it is related to climate change. It keeps talking about the importance of meditation and serving others. Then I realized it is more focused on individual actions and the meanings behind them. For example, most of the time people would just assume that the dumpsters are full of trash that has no value at all. However, the man had a really good idea to take the perfectly good food to the park to show people what they have been doing. I also really like the idea of the head, the hands, and the heart. I think it very well describes the degree of dedication when people are taking certain actions. 
   <br><br>

I also did some research on Transition Pasadena that is mentioned in the film. I was impressed when I looked at the calendar of events. The group hosts about 3-4 every week. There are events like Art Night and Listening & Storytelling that help with building community, as well as events like Climate Action Forum and Amphibians: Diversity and Troubles that directly address issues associated with climate change. This is an amazing example of how collective efforts can be done. People who are committed to individual actions push it to a higher level to make an impact on those who are around them. Because people usually feel more connected to those who are more similar to themselves and those living around them, it is a very good idea to encourage local communities to change the way they live.

After viewing this film "Being the Change" and Ken’s video. I totally agree with your points in the comment. I want to say that it is extremely hard for us to make a change, because many of us are already getting used to our modern lifestyle. Let's think how many people can put their car at home and use another transportation to go to work or school. That's native and pointless. How many people can suffer the cold and warm without turning their AC on. If one can't, it means most people can't do it. Instead of stagnating at this point, can we think of another way to solve this problem. Like Ken once said, before you want to change the world, you need to change yourself, or it will start to cause more troubles. For example, if you drive to school everyday, why others have to listen to you to ride a bike to school, that would be a joke. But how about making some small changes everyday, once it starts snowball effect, it will make a big change.


<br><Hr>
I didn't realize that the Transition Pasadena was so heavily active within the community at all. I agree that these events would truly make such a large difference in the community and help people get out of the bubble that they constantly exist in. Even events on UCSB's campus could be comparable to the Transition Pasadena. Just the other day, I went to an event that offered Painting and Snacks and it was one of the most wholesome events I've ever been to. It helped me connect with the people around me, and quite frankly, just sitting outside in the grass with the sun beaming down on me made me appreciate the Earth. More often than not, our bustling schedules make it so that we can't appreciate the smaller, more beautiful moments in life, and doing things like meditation help people become much more self reflective and appreciative. "Being the Change" was a perfect example of how lifestyle changes to save the planet go beyond putting a can in a recycling bin, they genuinely do start from within.

Overall, I really enjoyed Being the Change.  It was super interesting seeing how Peters's work opened his eyes to the problems that our world is facing, and how he dealt with the pressure to do something.  It was encouraging hearing him talk about how he didn't give up when learning about the many problems with the climate of the world, and how his first step was moving from NYC to a quaint home that was more in tune with nature.  I think that the film did a really good job showing different options that people can take to live more mindfully, and how living mindfully actually affected the life of Peter and his family.  however, I think that some of the lifestyle changes Peter made were very extreme for the average American, like quitting flying altogether or only driving a car that runs on veggie oil.  I know that a lot of students are out of state and international, so it is not so simple to just "bike home," and many students don't have the resources to invest in a car that runs on veggie oil.  I really liked how the film focused on living mindfully and in tune with the world, like reusing waste and meditating, and gave lots of examples of small changes that are easy for people to make in their everyday life that doesn't have to be super expensive (like installing solar panels or building a house that is low energy) or a drastic lifestyle change.  Though some things suggested by the film seemed a little extreme to me, like not having kids and quitting flying altogether, I think the film did a really good job communicating the importance of living mindfully and reconnecting with nature and what brings you joy. I felt very inspired by the film to be more conscious of my lifestyle choices.

I really enjoyed "Being the Change." While at first, I thought it was quite similar to other films and readings we have had about how individuals are taking drastic action to reduce their climate footprint, I found it to be much more convincing to me. I think this is due to two separate factors: the film shows how this lifestyle can conform to our everyday desires and needs and it shows the psychological benefits of the changes one has to make. Even though I understood the merits of change that was featured in previous films (such as the minimalist documentary), I couldn't help but see it as a great sacrifice that I am just not willing to take at this moment. For instance, the main people in the minimalist movie completely transformed every aspect of their life in order to live the way that they were. Even though the actions taken by Peter and the others in this film were massive compared to what I do, they were still living fairly normal lives. For instance, Peter worked as a scientist for NASA. He achieved his lifestyle by working hard to adapt his needs to climate friendly practices. One great example of this is when Peter drove a vegetable oil car, showing how he can still enjoy easy transportation while not releasing new CO2. Also, I thought the film did a good job of showing how there are multiple benefits to living a lifestyle based around reducing our carbon footprint. For instance, instead of portraying changes in lifestyle as sacrifices in order to achieve a goal, the changes made are shown to be positive and have good psychological effects. It always looks like the people profiled are enjoying their new life, free from what they see as a culture indoctrinating us into constantly consuming fossil fuels.

For the film in this week, I feel more promising of being a climatarian, because for some previous films, they use some terrible scenes and the what our future would to remind us what we are doing right now is extremely lethal to Earth. However, for this film, it gives us hope. The whole film is very positive, like by doing every small things which are green to Earth is actually extremely helpful. The creators approached climate change on every level, including farming, sustainable energy, recycling, living arrangements, and education.
   <br><br>

Also, education is a very important part for our future generation, because they are our future, since nowadays the people who have power don’t do many thing to change our Earth, they need to realize it.

From my perspective, this documentary is very different from the documentaries I have seen before. In Peter’s documentary, there is no cold and hard data and no very professional opinion toward the issue of climate change. In the film, it only has his family and his friend who affected by him. “He embarked on a journey to change his life and the world. He began by bicycling, growing food, and making other simple, fulfilling changes. Ultimately, he slashed his climate impact to under a tenth of the US average and became happier in the process.” Peter’s documentary introduces the life that can protect our environment, it makes people feel optimistic after watching the video. People would think that it is not hard to protect our planet, and we can still live very well in Peter’s way of living. People can solve the problem of climate change with the spirit of dance, gracefully and happily.

I believe more and more people will accept the science and concerned about global warming. And more people are willing to take action to make a better future for their descendants.

In this week's film I learned about Peter’s lifestyle and how he contributes to the change of environment through his acts of kindness and living a relaxed meditated life. He demonstrates his own individual actions and we see that they make a big impact when it comes to reducing his carbon footprint. In the beginning of the film a powerful quote is stated that got me thinking, "My actions aren't the only true belongings' ' for me this meant that we should never expect everything to be perfect or our actions to be the greatest but to know that our actions can have consequences. Peter lives a simple not at all luxury lifestyle with his two kids who influenced him to write his book where he talks about the head meaning the intellectual part of his life, the hands meaning doing things physically with your own labor work, and the heart that he describes as finding meaning and satisfaction in the things you do. These three aspects in his book, hopefully help influence and inspire other people to start caring for the world and doing things in a more meaningful manner that will help them gain mental peace and contribute to a healthier environment as well. Someone who stood out to me in the film was Pancho-Ramos, he lives a sustainable calm lifestyle where he cares for others and he mentions that his happiness comes from his actions of serving others. This really touched my heart because Pancho, a very wholesome person makes a great impact not only in the lives of others but gathers food that others might not need or that might go to waste to give to those that he cares for, his neighborhood and the community. This relates to the part of the film where it is mentioned that individual action is as important as collective action. One person can make just the difference as a whole group of people so therefore any type of action that can help prevent food from going into vast amounts of waste will be beneficial to our environment. Peter and Rob try not to waste any food and keep the land fills from over producing. Rob dumpster dives and revels that many of the food thrown away is still in good shape and able to be eaten. As mentioned in the film 40% of the food being produced ends up being wasted so we should try our best to save or eat only what we can. If we end up with extra food try giving it away to your local community or the homeless that are in need. As a result, this film taught me that being a wholesome and caring person for others 
   <br><br>
will do great things for the environment and also benefit you emotionally, "accepting the reality that we make and do it in the spirit of dance, gracefully and with a smile."

I have already watched both of these films, and I must say that they are both so amazingly inspiring in their own rights. Both videos showcase applications of climate activism in touching and encouraging ways. Tying this back to the reading about effectively discussing the topic of climate change and maintaining intrigue when many may be easy to dismiss your points from bias, I feel as though Peter Kalmus and the interviewees of Tomorrow, they approach this topic in a way that isn't so much threatening but motivating. Make a change to your personal well being as opposed to taking on the weight of world, even if you might be helping regardless. It's a lifestyle change to make you happier, be that growing your own nature garden from Tomorrow or riding a bike. They're more benefits than just saving the planet, which should be incentive enough but as we already know it is not. 
   <br><br>


I really feel as though these films just showcase the beauty in our world and how to discover it in a new light. They aren't so much projecting the dismal collapse of humanity--though I personally don't have an issue with this approach I am familiar with how disheartening it is--so it really is nice and refreshing new approach. Tomorrow in particular remains one of my favorite films to date as it's just so uplifting seeing the stories of wonderful people really turning their lives around. Not only is it good, but it's also so attractive, I find myself wishing my life could be as neat as having a jungle in your backyard, and then we have Peter Kalmus tells me that it's entirely attainable. In short, I really appreciate these films and telling us there really IS something you can do, and through personal action you can inspire others to follow suit and make a revolution.

In the film Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, I thought there was an interesting concept brought up by Peter of how first is the head then from that the hands and then finally the heart. He explains that the head thinks of the impact of one action and the impact of the other action. In other words, the head helps think and decide and has an intellectual understanding. When it comes to the hands, they help you actually do stuff. For example, your hands help you fix an old car. The point of the matter is that hands bring you from the stages of just talking or reading about things to actually doing things. As for the heart, it is supposed to tie it all together. The heart is where you find meaning in all of this, where you translate the intellectual understanding into actually making your life more satisfying. An alternative way of thinking of the head, hands, and heart is to think of them as an opportunity to learn something, opportunity to do something with their hands, etc. Although this whole concept with the head, hands, and heart intrigues me, I would challenge this concept in the sense of it allegedly going from head to hands to heart. I would say it does not necessarily always fit this order. For instance, some may have their heart in it before they actually put their hands to the physical work of the issue. It was told and shown within this film that when people do more environmentally friendly things they feel happier and like they have more meaning in their life. Honestly, it makes sense that people who do more environmentally friendly things feel as if they have more meaning in their life because by doing so they are doing the actions for something that is bigger than themselves, the planet. These people are taking into consideration future generations, they are trying to make sure that their great grandchildren have a world left to live in, which can also contribute to them being happy. As a kid I used to watch PBS and I remember one of those tv shows talking about using vegetable oil to power a car, so it was nostalgic in a way to me to hear of this method being discussed again because nowadays people only talk about Tesla’s as being a “solution” to our carbon footprint. Meanwhile, there’s methods such as vegetable oil that causes someone’s carbon footprint in terms of car mobility to go down. As Peter mentioned, this method is basically putting CO2 in the air that came out of the air instead of CO2 that came from deep underground. In addition, Peter is getting the waste vegetable oil from local restaurants, so these oils might have otherwise gone to waste, so he is helping reduce our food related waste with this method. After all, 40% of the food produced in the US ends up not eaten and just goes to waste. If you put this wasted food into the landfill, it will turn into methane, thus ending up with the planet in worse condition.
     <br><br>
  I was intrigued, yet utterly confused when Peter mentioned how his wife and him wanted a third kid but in order to be a part of the middle path and not contribute too much to the whole population growth, they decided not to have a third kid. One of Peter’s friends decided to not have any kids at all because of this population growth idea. Don’t get me wrong, I understand how the rapid growth of the population is damaging to our planet, however why do these people make it seem as if the only way they can possibly have children if they make the kid themselves, are these people completely ruling out adopting or fostering, then maybe after fostering adopting. For instance, if Peter and his wife wanted another kid, why didn’t they just adopt. How I see it is, some children are already placed into this world with biological parents that do not want to raise them or are not fit to raise them, Peter and his wife wouldn’t be creating another child into this world but they would help love, raise, provide, and nurture a child if they were biologically their own. I found this part of the film completely confusing as if they forgot about the concept of adoption and fostering. Before watching this film, I had never heard of the idea of building a Leeds platinum certified house, and the concept is interesting, but as the video mentions, it might be unrealistic because of how pricey it is. I knew we had a lot of Americans with food insecurity, did I know it was 50 million Americans that have food insecurity, no. I knew as Americans were wasteful with our food. I knew these main concepts but was still shocked when the numbers were added to the two correlating concepts and that we have enough food to feed 2 US yet 50 million Americans have food insecurity. Make it make sense, why are people suffering from food insecurity when there is beyond enough food to feed everyone. Yet again, Americans are proving their stereotypes of being spoiled and wasteful. 
         <br><br>
        Towards the end of the film they bring up Joe Jenkins, the author of The Humanure Handbook. From my understanding Humanure is being used for composting from special toilets, however it’s still a little unclear to me what the composting toilet does exactly. For instance, what does the Humanure turn into, can someone please explain this to me? I think the idea of the Transition Pasadena/Repair Cafe Pasadena is an interesting idea. At this place they do free monthly repairs, for example, a toaster or clothing. Essentially they are trying to resurrect those broken items so they don’t end up in the landfill. This is a smart idea and instead of it is completely affordable since it’s free. It’s important to remember the ending quote and think of it whenever you make a decision regarding the environment or a decision in general, “whatever you do, do it with the spirit of dance, gracefully and with a smile.”

Incredibly thorough response! I could tell you put a lot of heart and personal emotions and thoughts into it. But I have to say, not only that, but your comment is very thought provoking! I love that you brought about your own confusion into the picture where Peter and his wife run into the dilemma of whether or not to have another kid. You bring up a point that I actually didn’t think of right off the bat: why not adopt? Adoption and fostering indeed is completely left out of the picture in this film, and I think it is worth investigating the effects of these efforts as they are today. One thing that I can come up with, is that perhaps the ultimate goal is still in the end to have either 1 or 2 kids per couple, and as such, there ideally should be no one left behind. However, there will always be a case of a runaway, orphan, or such, that could use a home, and equally serve their value in replacing our current human race at the rate necessary and sustainably possible. Additionally, like you, I have been aware of America’s food waste problems, but to what extent is always a shocking reminder, each time slightly varied but equally large in number, large enough I cannot picture it, nor want to, as it seems like it is our fault for not finishing our food and for over producing everything. At the end of your response, you bring up the idea of Transition Pasadena where free monthly repairs for virtually all sorts of items are offered here. Aside from how affordable this place is, completely free, this place is so important revoluntarly in that it is a step forward towards ending consumerism and patching up broken things, and mending them for use as long as possible again. This is a great step forward to the solution of reducing waste, not just food waste in general, and various shops are popping up with similar concepts for one day rentals of all the supplies you could possibly need (e.g. electric drill), and just return it afterwards, without ever having to buy the equipment for its one time purchase.

After watching the movie “Being the Change”, I feel so touching about the family in the film. Peter’s lifestyle is an example of how to live simply and being happy. It is so encouraging that his whole family only contribute 1/10 of the average gas emits which inspired me that it is possible. In this film, people are told that when people do more environmentally friendly things, they will feel happier and their lives will be more meaningful. To be honest, people who do environmentally friendly things feel that their lives have more meaning, and that makes sense. Because in doing so, they are acting for something bigger than themselves – the Earth. These people think about future generations, and they try to make sure that their great-grandchildren have a world to live in, which also contributes to their happiness.
   <br><br>


It might be difficult for everybody to follow Peter’s lifestyle. However, we can do some tiny things, such as riding bicycles and taking public transportation instead of driving cars, save electricity, buy less clothes, taking non-stop flight, etc. Tiny things cumulated together may also change the world.

I also found the family's story of environmental minimalism to be incredibly inspiring. The fact that Peter Kalmus was willing to steer away from his career in theoretical physics to environmentalism just goes to show that with enough will power, and a plan, you can cause more change than you think. I think that this principle is exemplified beautifully in Peter's concepts of the Head, the Hands, and the Heart. If someone has the intellectual knowledge about an issue, along with the willingness to work for change and the heart to understand the implications on life, then they can make waves in almost any problem that they are trying to solve. 
   <br><br>


His personal anecdotes about his family also inspired me to want to make change. Although I am young right now, I know for a fact that I plan on having a wife and a few kids when I get older. I've always had a soft spot for children: they possess the key to the future, and it can be accessed through raising them properly and ensuring they have a good education. But when Peter said that his children motivated him to become more environmentally aware, I couldn't help but think to myself: "What will the world be like when my future children grow up?" This scared me for a second, since we are currently on a trajectory that predicts that the Earth will be nearly uninhabitable within the next century. But then I remembered that if we all start to align our lifestyles more with the Kalmus family, then maybe we can grow old knowing that our children, and our children's children, will be in good hands.

I found this film to be very interesting and powerful. The opening of the film was very unique and engaging to me. I was astonished when I learned that humans have caused extinctions to be as common and rapid as when the asteroid hit the earth and wiped out the dinosaurs. The cinematography and music were extraordinary and moving when it showed the beauty of the earth and its wildlife. It made me realize that all of this is slowly declining and coming to an end. The filmers also made sure their goal was to produce a movie that could show the real destruction that we are facing and how we can actually change our inevitable doom. The film crew was unique in how they set out to various parts of the world and pointed out the economic effects that could bring humanity down. It was extremely sad to see that when economic growth begins to retract, so do the people in the areas and the food supply in those areas. In Detroit, the city has come to look like a scene from mad max. After focusing on how to create clean agriculture, the film begins to focus on energy. The environment is changing drastically caused by climate change affecting the water cycle on earth. All of which is due to industrial industries creating violent floods, droughts, and hurricanes that damage the ecosystems. I was shocked to learn that we are in the sixth mass extinction in history. Another key issue brought up in this movie is transportation and waste. In Copenhagen, people have begun to start using mass transport and bikes instead of individual cars. Also, in San Francisco garbagemen have begun using compost to battle pollution while at the same time saving many companies money and creating jobs. Another key point of the film is the education of future generations. In Finland, classroom sizes are much smaller allowing students to gain knowledge and become more confident in conquering issues in the real world such as the issue of climate change. It was fascinating learning about the Indian man who came from the bottom of the cast system to an elected official. Despite being part of a corrupt democracy, he did not keep the power for himself. He made sure to create a plan to help the community and the people in it. It created active participation by the citizens. The villagers cleaned the city and created a better school where now every kid goes. Many other officials should follow in his footsteps and not become corrupt and take money from big companies to exploit the lands. I really enjoyed this film and found it very informative and definitely recommend this movie to anyone.

After watching the week’s film, “Being the Change”. I find the film really interesting in a way that it represents that sustainability and solutions of climate change is possible if put into practice. I am definitely amazed that there is a happy family manifesting the idea of sustainable life, emitting only 1/10th of the average American carbon emission. I respect their way of living because it is really hard to travel around the world with an environmentalist mind of only using bikes, because this is hard for everyone to adapt due to preference and the relationship between the rapid growth of technology and our society getting influenced by it. However, The family that was illustrated in the film is very humbling because they are living a simple life and are content with everything they got, they do not take anything for granted but are really thinking on how to deal with climate change. The family’s lifestyle highlights the discipline and virtue of the family. Thus, Peter emphasizes the idea that the impact of an action could ripple and create a chain effect for another action. I believe that this is true in a lot of ways and that it is definitely seen as a ‘profound movement’ to the climate crisis just like Ken stated in the video. The family that was portrayed in the film is setting up a good example to everyone.

This video without a doubt offers a different living perspective of simplicity and sustainability. It tells the story of a family emitting merely 1/10 of the average American family carbon footprint. One of the main takeaways from this is their dependence on bikes. When you consider just how much of an individual’s carbon footprint is taken just from the production and usage of a car, it makes perfect sense that bikes are by far the most carbon efficient mode of transportation, with the only carbon produced from it being during production and transportation to stores. I think America could eventually switch over to this method of transportation, but it would take a huge cultural change in how bikes are marketed.
   <br><br>


On top of this, America needs to adopt the Slavic bike path construction method. Having cars acting as a barrier would incentivize bike riding among adults who otherwise deem the risk too high with traditional bike paths. I also agree with you on the fact that this family is the epitome of selflessness, sacrificing their quality of life for the greater good. If we could all take a page from their book, and not even to the extremity they display, this world would definitely be well on it’s way to averting this crisis, or at least dull it’s effects.

I really loved the film "Being the Change" because it made it clear to me that making a significant change is possible, all while still living a fruitful life. The fact that the family only emitted 1/10 of an average American emits is completely inspiring. However, it is hard to imagine how every person can strive to do the same thing as this family. Some people commute to work, some people need to fly home to see their family. Overall, what I came to the conclusion of while watching this film was this- it will be impossible for every American family to do the same thing that these people have done. However, we can start with downsizing. Smaller houses, smaller cars, and less food waste. It makes me so frustrated when people like Jeff Bezos donate billions to climate change research but then buy the biggest, most expensive house in LA. That house alone has such an enormous carbon footprint, and he's basically going against everything he pledged to do with his donation.

I'll be honest I was really confused watching the film Be The Change. It initially seemed like a film just preaching a lifestyle that includes meditation and inner peace. It took me a while to really understand what the big picture was. The meditation allows him and his family to rid of all the negativity put out there. They allowed themselves to only focus on their lifestyles without the temptation of the outside world. It also proves that a life without a lot of things is very doable. It kinda puts me at ease to know that the lifestyle changes are very easy if you have the right mindset and the right people around you. I always wondered how difficult living a sustainable life is. The film also sheds some light on freeganism. As much as Ken would explain it I honestly couldn't get the image of people dumpster diving and eating old, spoiled food. I knew that is far from what freeganism is but that was my initial impression of it. Now that I have actually seen what it is,  it is quite respectable. I like how the guy said that if the proper institutions are put into place, freegans wouldn't have to jump into dumpsters. If something were to be done I'm sure freeganism will gain a lot more support as I'm sure it deters a lot of people because you may need to jump into a dumpster to get your food. I think the film did a great job of showing how your lifestyle would look if you made the changes to benefit the planet.

While watching Being The Change it reminded me of the film Minimalism. In Minimalism the main idea was how to live a happier life and Being The Change the main idea was how to live a happier life while helping the planet, which is think is a win-win. I want to be happy and knowing that I am helping the planet makes me more happy. This film is really inspiring cause before it seemed very hard to be content by living a life where you can not eat as much food, you can not buy as much clothes, and you can not travel the world. However knowing that you can live a life by not doing these things and being so much happier is inspiring. I liked the part of the film when they said that you should try to make a change each week. I feel like no matter how little the change, you will help the planet if you make one change each week for a year. That is 52 changes to help save our planet. That makes me so happy because I feel like I am doing a good job and maybe now that I have the momentum I can help other people make changes to their lives to help our planet. However the hardest part of this process is starting, but this film has inspired me to be happier while saving the planet.

The film, Being the Change, helped me understand just how attainable and fulfilling a low emission lifestyle can be, even for a family of four. While it does take effort and a lot of conscious decision making, emitting a tenth of what the average american does is very plausible. And it's critical that we achieve this, as Ken points out, in order to meet the goals set by the Paris Climate Accord. The changes that Calmus makes in his own life are many of the same ones we have discussed in previous weeks; bicycling more, driving less, composting food waste, and eating a primarily plant based diet. However there were decisions the family made that I don’t are very achievable for the average American. Changes such as adapting their family car to run on vegetable oil, or constructing an outdoor bathroom to assist in the composting of “humanure”. Maybe its the complexity and commitment needed to achieve these changes, but I struggle to see myself switching these aspects of my life, let alone a large portion of our country.
   <br><br>
But even if most people don’t make these changes, when individuals like Calmus come together and work towards these goals, I think their impact becomes much greater than just the sum of their individual actions. With enough people becoming aware of their carbon footprints and wasteful behavior, a true cultural shift can become a reality, and politicians and businesses will follow suit.
   <br><br>
Unlike most other environmental films, this movie left me much more hopeful for our future.

<p>
I really enjoyed watching “Being the Change” and liked the fact that Peter’s family prime example of what a future family dynamic could like. Although the nuclear family isn’t for anyone and society should not restrict us to that lifestyle, many Americans often conform to that dynamic. This being said, the sustainability of a whole family’s lifestyle, that Peter’s family so beautifully put into action, is the cultural change that must be implemented to gear our society towards a life with a lower carbon footprint.
   <br><br>

On the other hand, the documentary also mentioned intrinsic motivations and how they align with your moral principles. We can add more meaning to our lives by taking action and doing things that are beneficial for our environment which in turn are beneficial for us on so many levels. Taking care of our earth is something that we must implement into our daily lives, whether it be through making daily diet choices, transportation choices, or being a climate activist. The documentary emphasized the fact that individual action is just as important and collective action. This being said, our daily choices and actively choosing options that are beneficial for the earth the climate is one way we can exercise our power and be climate activists.

The film 'Being the Change' showed us the benefits of growing your own food and how easy it is to do it yourself. Living a simple life that gives back to the planet gives people a sense of fulfillment and so does sharing their skills. They emphasize how people buy things to fill a void and how corporate jobs led to dissatisfaction in their lives. Growing their own food not only opened up an opportunity to be out in nature, but it helps them lead healthier lives. Another thing they emphasize in the film that I agreed with, was that people should take individual action because the more that people care, the more normalized this kind of lifestyle will become. As it was mentioned in the film, we need the government to do more and inform the public of easy steps they can do to reduce global emissions. One example is taking reusable containers to the stores, instead of having to use reusable bags. 
    <br><br>
Doing and partaking in these kinds of environmental actions also give people a sense of meaning because they feel like they are contributing to something bigger than themselves. This film was very inspirational and it made me put into perspective the kinds of things that bring me joy and fulfillment in my life. A lot of what brings me happiness is being a part of something bigger than myself that I know is doing good and giving back. Gardening is an excellent way to give back to the planet will also gaining a new skill and being able to feed yourself by growing your own food.

After watching the film Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution I realized how much more I can be doing to reduce my carbon footprint. I liked how the film pointed out. the fact that this Revolution has to and is starting at the lowest scale possible, in individual households. It was made clear that their primary goal was not to convince the masses to change their way of life, but individuals, their family, and their friends. I thought it was great that Peter included his daily meditation routine in the film because I think everyone living in the United States today can take time out of the day to just relax and let go of their stressors for a period of time every day. The majority of people living in America today, including myself, put a ton of stress on themselves to make a great deal of money in order to obtain happiness. Meditating at least once a day takes this stress off of our minds and allows us to focus on the things that truly matter. Another thing that I appreciated the film made a point of was when Peter's good friend explained to him that he was using his wealth to reduce his carbon footprint. Instead of buying a new car and whatnot, he decided to buy solar panels and place them on his roof. By doing this he provided his house with electricity and hot water. Overall, I think we can all take away the fact that change needs to occur now,  and that this change can provide a new and improved lifestyle for us Americans.

I think that the film "Being the Change '' is an incredible film because it tackles climate change from such a holistic approach. I mean when was the last time that someone told you that you could fight climate change via meditation? If I had to guess I would say never. But what a unique tool meditation is; I think Kalmus' revelation about this is astounding. In order to tackle the systematic failures that we see externally, we have to reflect and repair internally at first. The idea of reconstructing our internal systems and how we think is crucial to solving the climate crisis. How can we be expected to go out and solve problems if we still have not confronted our personal issues? Meditation and simply the practices of being more present and altruistic allow us to be happier and impact more lasting changes not only within ourselves but also our communities.
 
    <br><br>

 
Another part of the film that I enjoyed was the concept of the three H's: The Head, The Hands, and The Heart. I think that any meaningful change has to come from roots in all three. First one needs to process the problem and determine which solutions are feasible and worthwhile, this stems from the head. Then there is the idea of actually putting those thoughts into action, or the hands. Finally there is the idea that all we do should grow from a passion in our souls, a determination to do good by neighbors, simply because doing good is what makes us feel good; this is the heart.
 
    <br><br>

 
"Being the Change '' really challenges the wide spread of narrative of climate solutions that either involve extreme innovation in a small window of time or forfeiting all technology for a simple yet desolate life. I think that Kalmus does a good job of showing that we do not really need either. We can have great lives, where we connect with nature, our families, and communities more, and where we also foster new and fun skills, without going back to the stone age or zipping ahead to the future. I am really glad that I watched this film a second time because it not only makes lifestyle changes like this seem possible but also desirable.

<p>
"Being the Change" is a truly inspiring film that depicts actually making changes that support a climate-supporting lifestyle. Peter Kalmus cuts his fossil fuel use to 1/10 of the average American through numerous different changes, with everything from using a car that runs off of vegetable oil to an outdoor bathroom/fertilizer system. The film shows how an individual can make an impact, starting with small changes.Â 
    <br><br>

The argument of whether or not it really makes a difference arises with the fact that it's just one person. Often, fixing the environment is put on the individual when in reality big corporations and governmental action are the things that will make the biggest impact. Does one individual really have an impact by making lifestyle changes? If just one person stops flying, the plane still takes off. However, if many people start taking up these actions, it definitely will make a difference. Not taking an action to help the environment just because you're expecting that others won't as well is both contradictory and immoral.
    <br><br>

I like that this film showed a lot of actions that individuals can implement in their own lives. It presented both science and solutions in an accessible, easily understandable way. It connected one's own spirituality and state of being to the environment and our interdependence with it, which I appreciated. Overall, I enjoyed this film and appreciated what it had to say, and I'd definitely recommend it to others.

The film Being the Change was very interesting. I thought it was nice to hear what he thought about the things that we need to change; our family size, diet, transportation, etc. The part that stood out to me was when he mentioned he wanted a third child, but really held back because he knew population was a problem. Every single change he made in his lifestyle takes a lot of courage, as he is breaking away from the lifestyles that we’ve grown accustomed to. I like that he incorporated the head, hands, and heart. For me, it translated into the process in which we take up new changes. As he mentioned, it starts with understanding the problem, actually doing something, and finding meaning in the lifestyle change. This change is brought about within a community. As stated in the film, it starts with one heart, one house, and one block at a time. We are consumed by the idea that “having it all will make us happy”, and that is what is causing destruction. We must be positive and move towards a better lifestyle and what I seen from the film is making small changes can lead to a sustainable lifestyle.

Hello, I entirely agree with you that changing significant aspects of our lifestyles would have a positive impact on our environment. From diets to transportation, we should all be reassessing our way of living and find more efficient ways to live day-to-day. While it would be difficult for many to adjust, it would inevitably improve well-being of everybody, including our own planet. By collectively changing our way of living, we would be improving our environment for all living beings.

I absolutely loved the film Tomorrow, which I watched in another class as well as this one. They took such an international approach and I appreciated the way they portrayed climate action as a unifying goal every country must work towards in order to prevent further damage. The segment on urban farming was really interesting because I didn’t know there was a social movement supporting that, but it was so interesting to see the way people in Detroit have implemented it in their lives. They also highlighted European cities like Stockholm, who have already embraced many different types of green initiatives. Seeing the way these programs and the politics behind them work makes me believe that the United States could also be successful in these efforts, even if critics say otherwise. I especially enjoyed when they talked about new eco-friendly energy developments, like the use of geothermal energy and the factory they went to that was completely carbon neutral. The part about currency and the economy was a little confusing, and I would’ve appreciated if they had explained that better, since it’s something that I (and likely many other people) do not know much about. However I do think that in general, this movie did a good job of explaining changes we can make to help our world that could appeal to people who are already into climate justice and those who are not. This is especially important because many times, environmental activism projects accidentally alienate these people, when they should instead be engaging with them. I also liked the way they tied in the impact of the education system, because that is not something I have ever thought about before in terms of climate change, so that was very cool to learn about. This movie was just the right balance of logical and emotional to sound credible and make me care, without being annoyingly sappy.

I largely agree - Tomorrow was an excellent film showing us what people around the world were doing, and importantly, how it benefited the people within that community. If I wanted to advocate for a policy to adopt similar programs to the ones shown inside the film, well, now I have an easy reference.

I really enjoyed this week's film "Being the Change". This film was very eye-opening and motivational. It was inspiring to watch Peter live such a happy and healthy lifestyle while only contributing 2 tons of CO2 emissions in the process. Over time Peter was able to change and adapt his lifestyle to reduce his carbon footprint to 1/10th of an American's. While this is beneficial to our environment and encouraged, it is also very difficult to follow through with this and live this lifestyle. Many regular day routines would have to be stopped as one must find healthier and safer alternatives. One of the main contributors of greenhouse gas emissions is transportation. This aspect of life is very important as people have places to be and people to see. In the film Peter resorts to riding his bike as his main mode of transportation which reduces his carbon footprint by a lot. Unfortunately, some people rely on transportation for their occupation. For example, a gardener would not be able to carry his lawnmower and other tools if he were to use a bike as transportation. Uber drivers and other occupations would be unemployable if we saw a shift from cars to bikes and many industries would see economic decline. Nonetheless, If one is able to make changes to reduce their carbon footprint then they definitely should. Some people can adjust to these changes easier than other but as long as everyone tries to contribute to the cause it will make a difference.

After watching the film “Being the Change” it really made me start thinking about all the small but impactful changes I could be making in my life to reduce my carbon footprint. I was truly inspired by Peter’s journey that enabled him to cut down his emissions from 12 tons of carbon per year to just 2 tons. If enough people began changing their lifestyle like Peter has and is continuing to do, then it could have an enormous positive impact on our environment. Knowing this, it made me begin to think about how I could start my journey to seriously committing to reducing my carbon footprint. As Ken has mentioned in one of his previous lectures and the film “Wasted” expertly exposed, food waste is one of the biggest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. About ½-⅓ of all the food produced is wasted. This said I wanted to start my journey by first finding a way to help reduce food waste. As I was talking about this with my brother, he mentioned a company called Imperfect Produce. Some of you may know what this is already, but for those that don’t, it’s a company that you can subscribe to be sent a monthly box of cosmetically imperfect, but still very much edible food. My brother has been doing this for about four months now and is always pleasantly surprised by the produce he’s sent. Not only does it help save rejected produce from ending up in a methane-producing landfill, but it also exposes you to produce you might not be inclined to buy in the grocery store. On the down side, it is an online company, so the casualty of shipping and packaging is unavoidable. Although they do use 100% recyclable boxes that are picked up and reused by their company, as advertised on their website. Overall, I think this company can help everyone take an easy step towards reducing food waste.

I got my family hooked on Imperfect Foods 2 years ago and we still love it! Food waste is such an important and relatively easy thing we can fight. I often practice it by really ensuring all the edible food I have is eaten and that my fridge looks barren before I go shopping (my housemates can confirm). I think another thing that is relatively easy that we can do is to buy local food. I have thought a lot about this as a way to help me reduce my carbon emission as I already eat an entirely plant-based diet. A tangible way we can do this is to get our produce from the food bank (a lot of fruit is gleaned from the community), shop at farmers' markets, and shop at the co-op. I watched Demain, as I have already seen Being the Change and their talk about regenerative agriculture and buying locally entirely convinced me to become a member of the co-op. I know that this is not an economically feasible option for all since it can get on the pricey side, but I realized that I need to start utilizing the economic privilege I have to help drive the local economy and incentive changes in the market. Will it be more expensive and potentially make me less wealthy? You betcha, but I feel that it is completely worth it if my buying local produce drives down the prices and makes it more affordable for others. Moreover, we simply do not have much, if any time to think about what we can do tomorrow. Yes, circumstances occur that prohibit us from making changes we may want, but the ones that we can make right now, are changes we must make.

The film was great. The film "Being the Change" does a great job at actually showing the audience a family who quite clearly lives a life as the model of "change." It was a cool addition that Peter works at JPL and lives relatively close to Santa Barbara. I say this film is exceptional due to the simple fact that it gives the viewer a prime example of someone being an environmental activist. It shows how a very successful scientist found alternatives to end up living a sustainable life, not only for himself but also for his entire family. Although I do find one potential fault in this film. They did use Peter. Peter is not your average Joe. In a way this video can be discouraging to the everyday normal person. To do all the things that Peter did to cut his carbon footprint may have been easy to him but not for others. Especially considering he is a lot more knowledgeable about the situation at hand than almost anyone he would ever cross paths with. However I still feel the film did a lot more good for the audience than harm. The film sent a clear message to the viewers that first and foremost we have to stop leading such a materialistic life and second, we must believe in our ability to make change even if it's small.

[Being the change]
    <br><br>
I really like the approach of this documentary. At first, I was expecting it to be like the previous documentaries that we’ve watched: seeing the effects of climate crisis. However, Peter Kalmus’s story portrayed how a regular family can live a simple and happy life while producing only 1/10 of the climate footprint of an average American. After becoming more environmentally conscious, I try not to overwhelm my friends with the changes that I’ve made. According to Peter, we should do the opposite. We should let the world know the kind of changes that we are making, in hope that some will appreciate and follow. So, I’m telling myself now that don’t be afraid to tell and show my friends what I’m doing to help the planet. Even Peter’s PI/advisor looks up to him in terms of environmentalism, and that inspired me to do better because it’s not only the adults’ problem, it’s ours too! 
    <br><br>

I knew Peter’s intention of living in a tiny apartment in New York prior to his move to Pasadena, CA. I’m personally moving to New York in July and I’m currently in the process of apartment hunting. I’ve been looking at small one-bedroom apartments and I’m also open to studios. I’m also keeping in mind to find potential roommates. Not only will this method save me money, it will definitely cut my carbon footprints by a significant amount. However, like Peter, I’m scared to become disconnected with the natural world, so I plan moving back to Cali when I’m done with grad school. I know that city or urban life might be better for the environment in terms of cutting transportation and living in a smaller space, but will I be happy though? How could I be happy in a completely different environment? I think that’s something I will struggle with for the first couple months, but I know I can figure things out and make life simpler and happier with all the changes that Peter suggested. 
    <br><br>

Recently, my mom has picked up the hobby of gardening. She grew her own tomatoes and incorporated them into dinner last night. Honestly, it was really delicious, and I wasn’t expecting home-grown food to taste as good as store-bought ones. I think having someone experimented with someone new that could potentially be positive in terms of cutting carbon footprint, it serves as an incentive for me to do the same in the future. Like Peter, I also enjoy meditation. Even just for 5 minutes a day, I find the benefits extremely helpful in terms of managing stress and just putting my mind in the right space. I hope to learn more about it in a future course I’ll be taking through the ESS department next quarter.

While I was watching "Being the Change" I was quite confused about where the film was going since Peter Kalmus kept jumping from climate change to meditation, to positive thinking, then back to climate change and then composting. Yet, this all is interconnected as I have no learned. As Ken noted in this introduction video, the general message of the film is you can live a life without fossil fuels, and it can make your life better. Peter started with small changes, such as biking to work and having a more eco-friendly home. Then the changes became much larger, as Kalmus completely cut out flying and converting his car to use vegetable oil when his car is at high temperatures. All of these adjustments were possible for a family of 4 living in a rather urban area, which gives me inspiration and reminds me that it is completely possible to live a sustainable lifestyle and cut down personal carbon emissions while still raising a family and live in a busy area such as Pasadena. I was particularly impressed with Peter's vegetable oil car and his family's composting toilet; I don't understand how innovations like these are not in more households. It's a win-win for everyone as these alternatives save the planet and are cheaper. Obviously protecting our planet is a reward in itself, but I can only hope that people will reap the benefits of reducing their ecological footprint and live more efficient and wholesome lives.

I’d like to add on to how important it is that starting with small changes, like Peter did with his biking habits, is something I feel is necessary when approaching movements like climate change. Everybody can say on paper that they’re going to drop meat, not fly, and be a walking climate crisis poster, but when it comes to action, it’s admittedly hard to start. Peter sets a perfect example of how to transition from not being environmentally conscious to using unique solutions to lower his carbon footprint with stuff like his vegetable oil car. This shift reassured me in my belief of how setting small goals is the key for any sort of progress to be made. It also brought to light how viable living environmentally conscious can be, especially considering the setting takes place in Pasadena which isn’t too far from my hometown.

This film was incredibly humbling and inspiring. I was very intrigued by Peter’s life choices and how he was able to reduce his carbon footprint by 10. I am really interested in Peter’s car and would like to know more. I had never heard of a car run on used vegetable oil. It didn’t seem super reliable--its name was “Maeby” because “maybe we’ll get there, maybe we won’t”--said Peter and his wife. Can it run on a highway? These are all things I’m curious about because if this is something good for the environment without having to fully give up a car, this could be a good intermediary step between fully giving up a car. I thought it was very selfless of Peter to give up his current job that he loved in order to pursue more about the climate crisis. He saw an issue and decided that it was more important than sticking with a job he lived and worked so hard for. He wanted to learn more so that he could make better choices for himself and his family. He really does “walk the walk” rather than just “Talking the talk”. I’m not sure how I feel about meditation. I believe that some quiet time for mindfulness can be beneficial but I’m not sure that two hours is really the magic number to be enlightened and better the planet. It seems to work for Peter and everyone has different needs so whatever works! I also really liked how this wasn’t a forceful talk on veganism, in fact he said that if everyone were to just be more conscious consistently (turkey over beef, etc.) that would be better than 5% of the population going vegan. This gives me some satisfaction because I have been trying to do just that or choose tofu over chicken at a restaurant for example. In entirety, I think this was a great documentary and I’m glad it was included in this class.

My reaction to being the change was of happiness. I loved the people because of their pure love of nature and the environment. That is what more of our society needs to become if we want to do something major in the change of our earth and stop the current downfall. It was interesting to see that technology influenced college major was choosing to live his life and his families life in such a beautiful and different way than the norm 
    <br><br>

The film itself was very powerful, it was engaging and really made you think about changes in your life and the world that you wanted for your future and your children's future. It was beautifully filmed and made it even more inspiring to watch. The scenes and colors made it intriguing and almost made you subconsciously aware of how much lack of color and beautifulness our each would experience if we don't look at what we are doing to the earth and change it.

I agree the film made me think of how much our children will be deprived of in the wake of climate change. Even if steps are taken now, we will still face damning effects in the years to come. This inspires me to work as hard as possible to restore our planet and even allow it to thrive in the years to come. I have hope that we learn from our mistakes and work for and not against mankind and it's home. I too felt the color tugged on my heartstrings as I realized how beautiful the planet could be if we acted soon. Acting is unavoidable and is needed now. We morally cannot leave the Earth in worse shape for the generations to come.

As everyone else, I really enjoyed seeing a suburban family like the Kalmus’s and the minimalistic way they live in “Being the Change”. At first I was definitely put off by the way it was filmed, I almost forgot it was filmed only a couple years ago and not in the 90s. Personally, I didn’t find the way he communicated in the film to be very inspiring and passionate. I just didn’t feel like he really was able to resonate with people who are climate skeptics or those who believe it’s hard to live the lifestyle that he does. 
    <br><br>

I will admit that he is a father of two kids that he clearly loves dearly and has internalized the importance of generational justice for his kids to have a clean, safe environment to thrive in. Kalmus succeeded in reaching out to people’s pathos in that sense however, as a climate scientist I didn’t feel the same. Looking at this from an environmental justice standpoint, I would’ve wanted to hear more from him about how the way he’s changed his lifestyle can be accomplished for marginalized, low-income, and at-risk communities of color who don’t have the same privileges as him (aka someone with a higher education who works at a highly established government organization and can afford a suburban home as such).

Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution
    <br><br>
This film had a different perspective than the films. It looked more towards the individualistic solutions for climate change rather than the corporate problems. It makes one more hopeful of their role in the fight against climate change. I’m happy it promotes more than the negatives of climate change.
    <br><br>

My favorite part of the video was the solution of the grease powered car. Using Peter’s innovation, all cars can be run using this method. I’m confused on why this method hasn’t been incorporated with other cars. This minimizes grease waste and the CO2 released into the environment. 
    <br><br>

One part of the video that surprised me was seeing the absurd amount of food wasted. Food, as we see in Cowspiracy, is a major contributor to global warming. The fact that we don’t eat half of it is almost comical. There are many problems that many Americans have to solve in order to combat this issue of climate change.
    <br><br>

One part of the video I did not fully enjoy is the spirituality part. As pleasant as this idea is, I feel like it did not relate to the content of the class. However, I did appreciate how they mentioned that their meditation keeps their mind off the passion for stuff. This video mentions how American capitalism has influenced our desire for unnecessary goods, and it’s interesting to see how meditation can affect that. 
    <br><br>

One thing I enjoyed about the video is seeing the impact one individual can make without completely uprooting their entire life. The narrator has a family that lives relatively normal with a car, house, and “stuff”. Small, but important changes allowed him to cute his emissions by 10. These small changes, if done by the entire US population, can help control the effects of the climate crisis.

Watching this film left me in part confused. At first I didn't really the impact of the actions Peter was taking across his journey. Additionally, some of his solutions I found to be rather strange. However, as the film went on I began to see more and more about his transformation and his desire to combat climate change. The idea of making a big change, not all at once, but through incremental changes is stressed time and time again throughout the college experience. Professors always tell you, there's no point cramming everything the day before the test, it is by far better to learn a little bit every single day leading up to the midterm. Now this isn't quite the same, as the drop in carbon footprint will remain regardless, however, if you give up on the changes they mean nothing. Living a more sustainable lifestyle is in some ways similar to going to the gym. If you try to do a ton all at once, you will probably end up demotivated and end up giving up. Peters journey should serve as an example to all of us to what we can do on an individual level to reduce our carbon footprint as well as help our Earth. This might be a strange connection, but watching Peter drive around in his old car was very reminiscent of my high school years, driving around in my 20 year old Honda Accord. That part of the film connected with me on a personal level, and was surprisingly probably what convinced me the most.

Having been born and raised in Pasadena my entire life, this film was especially interesting for me because of the ways it showcased climate scientists at JPL and Caltech.  From my experience living there, I always observed a large disconnect within the city between those who are very environmentally conscious and those that simply are not.  Because most parts of Pasadena are very affluent, there is an observable neglect for the climate crisis as many residents own extremely large houses with multiple cars.  However, despite the divide between those that are environmentally friendly and those that are not, there still seems to be a general effort in the city to live more sustainably.  I applaud Kalmus for biking to and from work everyday as it is very difficult to travel anywhere in the San Gabriel Valley without a car.  Not only is there a poor public transportation system and practically nonexistent bike lanes throughout the SGV, there is also a stigma around any transportation that doesn’t involve a car.  I never once in my 18 years of living in the Pasadena area thought to take public transportation or ride a bike simply because no one else around me was doing it.  However, after watching this film and seeing Kalmus biking to work on a daily basis, I am more motivated to reconsider the transportation systems in my city.  

    <br><br>

Like many of the other films assigned to us in this class, I felt more motivated after watching this to reevaluate my lifestyle choices and live more sustainably.  A lot of the points made in this film heavily revolved around our constant consumption that is driven by the great amount of ads we see on a daily basis.  The idea of personal versus collective efforts is a theme stated many times throughout the film that really puts our efforts to mitigate the climate crisis into perspective.  One fact that really emphasized these ideas was the statistic Kalmus states about flying.  He states that when 3,000 people decide not to fly, 10 fewer planes are flown and thus less emissions.  This is huge for the environment as we know air travel is one of the worst things we can do for the climate crisis.  Not only did this film make me think about my personal decisions regarding air travel and food consumption, but also the political actions that I will take.  Learning about the Pasadena Foothills Climate Lobby in the film really made me consider taking even further action in politics in the future.  Prior to watching the film, I never knew this existed despite having lived in Pasadena for 18 years.  It was very interesting to see city leaders and residents from my hometown taking action in such effective ways. I hope to emulate this as I continue to move on in my college career and learn more details about the climate crisis.

I absolutely love this comment, and being from LA county, I have friends and family through Pasadena, it's cool to hear about your personal experience with the culture there. One thing I took away from the film, like you, was certainly the new opinion on collective action. If I stop eating meat, that won't make a huge difference, but if 100 people do, or we can get the dining halls to stop serving beef, imagine the exponential increase in effectiveness. Climate Change is proving to be a test of how well the human race can come together, and I daresay it may be too late before we find a real common ground.
    <br><br>


I like that although the protagonist, our boy Kalmus, is living what many may consider a "nonmodern" or almost primitive lifestyle, the documentary also shows the other couple that is 100% solar energy. I think showing this as an alternative to going back to barebones human society is smart precisely because people from Pasadena would be more willing to compromise with this middle ground. Challenging the stigma in Pasadena that biking is lame or that taking public transportation means you're broke is the next big challenge, and perhaps us SoCal people should take on the task ourselves, drawing back to collective action. If we can make biking and public transportation cool, we can change the culture, and the action will follow.

<br><hr>


I thought the points that you brought up about living in Pasadena comparison to the lifestyle shown in the film was very interesting. The point that you brought up about Pasadena being a very affluent area, and people neglecting the climate crisis made me think about how wealth affects the climate crisis. It seems that generally people with a lot of money have worked and are working hard to have the money that they want to buy whatever they want; A bigger house, a nicer car, all the newest gadgets and objects. They are the ones that fly the most, traveling across the world and have some of the largest carbon footprints. They have the means to have the largest carbon footprint but at the same time they have the money to reduce their carbon foot. When I personally think about how successful I want to be in my life I think that I don’t need endless amounts of money, I just want enough money to live a life where I can be environmentally friendly; Where I can buy local produce, solar panels for my roof, zero waste products, an electric bike. When I think about the wealthy putting the majority of the CO2 in the atmosphere, I get frustrated because they are the people that can afford to make an impact. I really liked how in the video how it showed the house that was very nice that was completely run by solar panels. This was able to show that you can be more well off and help the environment. We need helping the environment to become the “cool” thing to do, and people striving to make money to they can lower their footprint, buying adding additions to their houses like solar panels. 
    <br><br>
Similar to what you said this movie really motivated me. There are always more steps to take that can be more environmentally friendly, there is always more to learn and more action to take. This film was a little confusing for me, in that it felt a little bit all over the place, but I think it had some very important facts and points. As you pointed out the metaphor that was use in the video about flying and reducing the number of planes really stood out to me. This paired with the image of the main characters carbon footprint before he started to take action and then that after. It was crazy to see how much his footprint was reduced by just choosing not to fly. This made me feel even more strongly about finding approached other than flying to get to other places. I know making a change is hard and uncomfortable, but films like these show that it doesn’t all have to happen at once. Its gradual process and can become easy and natural.

<br><hr>
First of all I really like your comment. For me the other films we watched hit a different note than this one. Instead of focussing on the Doomsday scenario that awaits us in a few decades this film focussed on a positive message. Although the climate crisis  addressed,  and on an alarming note as well, i felt another vibe, hopefulness and joy. The people shown in the documentary did not so much advocate their lifestyle in a pressing way. Rather than trying to convince us that we really should do what they do because insert reasons here they showed us that they were happy. Without explicitly telling us what we should do they still increased my feeling of self-efficacy. I really feel that now I am in a more able state to help this crisis. Also I really liked the focus on individual action. Like you said, they mentioned the Lobby and it immediately increased my feeling of identification with other people and my feeling of being able to contribute to a better society.
<br><hr>
I really like the approach you took with your comment Theo. “I stop eating meat, that won't make a huge difference, but if 100 people do, or we can get the dining halls to stop serving beef, imagine the exponential increase in effectiveness.” That line summarizes the importance of individual action that was the topic of last week’s lecture. Additionally, I also really enjoyed this week’s film because I felt like the underlying message is very hopeful. There is always something else we could do to be more sustainable by changing our current lifestyles, and when you look at every suggestion in the film (and the class), it always has to do with breaking tradition. For example, the couple that has the 100% solar energy fueled house, or zero waste and mini houses that you see on youtube.
<br><hr>
I like your comment a lot, and it is interesting to hear your personal experience. I think being a vegan does make a difference on this planet. Eating things at the lower stage of the food chain is a great way to reduce the carbon footprint in the world and also can promote our health. Stop filling our meal plates with beef, lamp, pork, or chicken. Please start to prepare a delicious salad, enjoy the fruits and vegetables. For those of people who are addicted to meat, there are also alternative ways to help reduce the carbon footprint, while consuming an adequate amount of meat. Substitute beef or lamb with chicken and fish. Also, we can try to reduce the frequency of meat consumption.
     <br><br>

Also planes are one of the biggest greenhouse contributors on the planet. Even though a long massive train seems to release more greenhouse gases, the train is a more environmentally friendly way of travelling. The film is very inspiring, and I admire and respect these people who decide to not fly. I wish more and more people can realize the situation we are facing together now, and we could work together to eliminate the greenhouse gases.


<br><hr>
It was interesting hearing about your experiences living in Pasadena! From the film, I garnered a view of the environment as more environmentally sustainable and conscious than the perspective which you shared. I appreciate your perspective, as well as your newfound motivation. From watching the film, I found that the community oriented sustainability events seemed to garner both interest from the community and support from Caltech/JPL. Although in reality is not necessarily the majority of the population, the fact that the awareness for these sort of events is growing is good, and hopefully they can garner support outside of Southern California. I’d be interested in seeing how individuals form their own communities to tackle sustainability and to leverage the skills of community members. I was quite impressed by the monthly gathering of engineers and sewers in helping their neighbors in Pasadena/Altadena. I hope that these sort of groups can be formed (and are being formed!) across the US.

This week set on being the change it was interesting to see how Peter comes reduced, footprint to 1/10 of the average American. Last year I had the pleasure of being in a class on FaceTime with him exciting year all the different ways he was benefiting climate science and all the ways he took to help it in his life. His car is running on leftover vegetable oil quite exciting and how meditation benefits his life. It was especially lovely to hear that he knew it was hard not to have a car in this world. But he did figure out how to make an altar work. Seeing his way of life is putting together all the forms of life we seen previously and taking the most affect. Your voice SUVs, he talks to other people that have more money to spend on living a climate activist life and the ways they changed. He has a low-cost basis and can support the family out of the way he lives, which is especially Refreshing to hear. I would like to speak with him on the benefits of meditation and how it helps his life and the stresses of working at a university in the way he does.


<br><hr>
I think I really vibe with this comment and it is interesting to hear from another similar perspective of climate change in suburbs. From where I am from, the South, people usually are less concerned about climate change than people where in Cali, especially Santa Barbara and other small towns which give birth to modern movements. I had no previous in-depth experience of Climate change before coming here, as before I view products and actions just as they are, exclusive of their climate footprints. I hope this idea would spread wider and wider across the nation and let people from rural areas be aware of their impact on climate change. 
     <br><br>

On the other hand, I believe the idea mentioned in the film “Head, Hand and Heart” is a powerful model. In the film he applied this model to his action against climate change and personal lives, and I believe it has a lot of philosophy behind it. Most people have the heart and head, but they refuse to put their thoughts into action. Some people have the hand and the heart, but without properly knowing what to do, they are just wasting their time. Some others do know what to do and put it into action, but they do not enjoy or appreciate the process. Only people who have the head, the hand and the heart would making lasting and effective changes for themselves and the world



<br><hr>
As this course progresses further, I get more inspired to make changes to my life in order to do what I can as an individual to help combat the climate crisis.  But, I know that I will not be making any major changes, like not buying a car altogether or making changes to my future living space in order to greatly reduce my carbon footprint.  This is because while I am concerned about the climate crisis, I was not willing to make major changes because I feared that I would be making my life difficult.  I believe that this concern also applies to many other people, because even though we say that we do care about the environment and worry about the climate crisis, we do not make all of our decisions with the climate in mind.
     <br><br>
After watching this film, I feel less concerned about making big changes to my lifestyle because Peter Kalmus is living a comfortable life while also greatly reducing his carbon footprint.  This film made me realize that it is possible to live a normal life while also making sure all your actions were made with the climate in mind.  
     <br><br>
It is important for people to watch films like this because people would not be willing to make big changes to their comfortable life just for the environment.  Someone with a large family might be afraid to change their family’s lifestyle because they fear their changes could make their lives more difficult than it has to be.  The people in the film show that it is possible to live a comfortable and fulfilling life while changing their lifestyles so that their carbon footprint is greatly reduced.



<br><hr>
I am not from Pasadena, so I don't know what you have experience there but thanks for letting us know as it is a valuable input as any of the other comments. I really enjoyed watching this documentary. The way the Kalmus's family lives was really inspiring for me as they did not require many things to be happy. Something I really liked was when Kalmus said that "whatever we decide to do, we should do it in the spirit of dance; gracefully, and with a smile. I believe this a powerful and honest quote that really demonstrates that in order to encourage others and bring change, we need to express our happiness through our actions. We should not go around and brag about the things we do for this planet, but rather let our own personal and collective actions do that for us. Nobody who is in the environmental movement is perfect. They are normal humans who have had an epiphany to change the way they live and serve not only the earth but others. This powerful message was said by Pancho who believes that serving others is far more important that forcing people make a change. By helping others, it makes those who were helped to do the same of others in the same way they were helped. 
     <br><br>

Kalmus also emphasized the importance of being in the middle. We should not become nor encourage people to go to the far extreme in order to help the world. There has to be a balance on our lives of the things we can do to reduce the greenhouse emission without having a miserable and regrettable life. To encourage people to take a middle ground could potentially lead to some of those people to become even more eco-friendly. Change should not be force but encouraged. How would we feel if someone made us eat something we don't like for whatever reason? I am pretty sure we would be angry at that person and consequently to that food. Therefore, while I believe change needs to be immediate and necessary, we need to achieve it in better ways like Kalmus tried to do throughout the film by showing the way he lives.

I'm also a SoCal native, around 45 minutes away from Pasadena. I had no idea that the groups expressed in the film (Foothills Climate Lobby, Transition Pasadena, the Repair Cafe) existed, and I wonder how many groups like that exist in my own corner of San Gabriel Valley. I don't think my home city cares much about sustainability, but I also never considered Pasadena an underground hub for green living either!

     <br><br>

I agree with your bit about Kalmus's choice of transportation: the few times I've had to take public transportation in my city, it's been an absolutely miserable experience because of how underfunded it is. I've also never considered biking, even though I do it here at UCSB, because I think drivers are generally much less cognizant of the existence of cyclists, not to mention the lack of decent bike paths. This is where political actions and personal choices can combine: like stated in "Being the Change", collective action has a far greater impact than individual actions. I think that I'm going to look into any local groups back in my home city that work to support the creation of better bike paths or greater funding for public transportation.


<br><hr>
Totally agree with you, Meredith! I have a similar experience living in Orange County. Transportation other than by car is stigmatized. You are sort of expected to have a car here. None of my friends (including myself) ever took the busses here. In fact, my first real experience with public transit was when I came to UCSB. Before that, I rarely biked and never once stepped foot onto an OCTA bus. I actually appreciate what the university and this class has done in opening new horizons for students to use alternative, green transportation. 
     <br><br>


Challenging this stigma is going to be difficult. You are seen as "broke" if you take the public bus or bike. It's a totally different culture in OC than it is in SB. But I think we can do it. Like Ken said, one of the best ways to change our current situation is to vote. By voting in our local elections we could elect people who are for destigmatizing alternative transportation. We can make change through voting!


<br><hr>
What a wonderful experience! People always look for a sense of belonging. I am sure that you are proud of Peter. He was talented. To obsess in something in 20 years and to have the influence both in the field and out of the field is the best thing for an individual. Most of the people just have a nine days' wonder to everything and can not keep for any one of them, and they still do not know what is the significance of their life. 

     <br><br>

Back to Peter, it is hard to say how many people will have the same lifestyle as him. His lifestyle, making everything on his own, is also not the most efficient way for society. It can cause the decay of the economy and influence a lot of people. It also wastes a lot of time and resources (no economy of scale). The life quality people also can not bear. Most people spend time on better life quality, material life quality. Thus, this way, the lifestyle, may not help the world environment a lot.


<br><hr>
I went to school in Pasadena and lived in Highland Park in LA, so I was also interested in the local aspect of this movie. Like Meredith, I definitely see a huge disconnect between the environmental ideals and action in this area. A lot of people are liberal and support environmental policies, yet still live in large houses with multiple cars and consume a lot. However, I think that is also slowly changing, as people become more aware of the climate crisis. Because Pasadena is such a family area, I think inter-generational learning from the current younger generation to their parents is probably having a large effect as well. I can totally see how Pasadena could reshape their area to be low-carbon, by growing their own food, having more people live in houses, and increasing good public transportation. At the same time, I don’t know how much work the people in Pasadena would be willing to put in to reduce their climate impact. Like Kalmus said, it’s scary not knowing what the future holds, because right now it doesn’t look good. We don’t know if change will happen fast enough, and while some people may be thinking about the environment, I don’t know if it’s enough. That’s why I feel like personally it’s more worth it to work on systemic change through city-wide, state-wide, nation-wide policy than trying to convince the majority of people to give up the comforts they’ve gotten so used to. I’ve tabled for environmental organizations and let’s just say the majority of the population isn’t interested.


<br><hr>
I agree that it was quite impressive that Kalmus took his bike every day. Personally, I grew up in a small town with really poor public transportation so I took my car everywhere. While biking is more environmentally conscious, most of the time I do use my car is to go grocery shopping and I can’t really fit most of the things I buy in a bike basket. For that reason, I’m not sure I could give up my car. Here, I haven’t needed a car because the transportation system is way better than where I’m from. Most of the time I take my bike but for Target trips, it’s really convenient to have a bus that goes straight there. That’s one thing I like about living in a bigger city, transportation is a lot easier.

     <br><br>

I also found it interesting that Kalmus had the family but still basically maintained a mostly normal lifestyle. There were, of course, some things I didn’t want to try myself, like Jenkins “Humanure Handbook” did not seem like something that I could do myself. Other than that, it seems like they lived a happy life while still helping our environment. This really shows that we could reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by a lot, and it wouldn't be very hard to do either.




<br><hr>
I'd agree that I also reevaluate myself a bit after watching this film. I too live in an area where there are a lot of people that are simply not aware of many of our climate change issues. There is also very poor public transportation in my town, and generally poor environmental infrastructure. I feel that if more of these things existed in my city, then people would be much more receptive of these climate change issues and take actions against them. I also think there is an overall stigma against those who take public transportation, and it largely inhibits people peoples receptiveness to adopting clean transportation.




<br><hr>

I think it is such an important, as well as reoccurring point that if those around us aren't doing something we won't be either. We are a social species and we pay attention to what others are doing. If our neighbors are using public transport or bikes, then we will start to and it becomes a cycle. Similar with being a vegetarian. I was a vegetarian for 2 years and my friends and family would tell em that when we went out to eat or cooked, generally they would eat vegetarian because I was. It is a ripple effect that is so important in inspiring that change you want to see. 
     <br><br>

Another important point in this comment is that our consumptive lives are driven by the constant ads we are bombarded with. We need policy to limit the power of ads and consumerism because the ads are able to tap into us psychologically in a way that we have a difficult time disputing. If the ads were  to not exist and there were more laws limiting consumerism  our lifestyles would inherently be much more sustainable.



<br><hr>
It really encourages me to see other people that can directly relate to the films and lectures. I love that this film let you see a different point of view and motivated you to want to make more changes in little parts of your life back home. It is so great! Especially because, as you said, in your area there is a stigma around non-car transportation and it seems as if many people there do not really care so much about being environmentally conscious. To be honest, reading this makes me respect Kalmus more and it is interesting to be able to hear about how most of everyone else in the area is.
     <br><br>


Whether in Pasadena or not, we can all be inspired by Kalmus going against the grain and doing what he understands is best for the environment and world. I feel like theres a good amount of us who are from areas where there is a stigma around public transportation, and where being environmentally friendly is looked upon as dumb or uncool. It is motivating to see where one person can make a change to their life in a community where it is not mainstream, and know that there are others out there among us even if we feel alone.




<br><hr>


I too love close to Pasadena and understand what you were saying about the disconnect. I agree with the point you had made about never even taking the time to consider if I could take public transit or just ride my bike places. Instead, I would drive my car every where even if it wasn’t far at all. I too have a new view after seeing this film. I have learned so much about the problem but also about what I can be doing to make a change and actually alter my lifestyle to help the environment. It is crazy how much I can cut off of my carbon footprint by taking public transit or not flying or riding my bike and so many other things. This film was actually uplifting compared to some of the other films we have seen in this class.



<br><hr>


I 100% agree. I’m not a bigger city like Pasadena my town is lot more rural but there is still such a stigma around riding your bike. I think it might have to do with people in the United States hating poor people. You know a I’m sure a lot people don’t ride their bike because they don’t want to come off as poor and be judged. In fact many poor people who are on the border of living in poverty consider themselves to be not poor and sometimes middle class. If we want to be the change we want to see in the world we have to break through these stigmas and really challenge the status quo. You riding your bike should be the so called affluent thing to do.




<br><hr>
This film was more optimistic than the other environmental films we have watched, rather than being negative about the damage we have done to this planet, this film inspires us to be the change the world needs. Tomorrow is a film that should be watched by anyone who understands the impacts of climate change but doesn’t know what they can do as just one person to help. This film does a good job of breaking down the issues of climate change in different categories Agriculture, Energy, Economy and more. It gives us way to solve climate change one step at a time such as using solar energy and cutting back on meat.

I love the idea of biking to work. My internship with Sanuk at The Deckers Brands offers a monetary incentive for biking to work, small but significant if done everyday. For a company with the mission statement paralleled to the themes in this film, I can happily say this is one of the simple changes I've made in my life to seek fullfillment and be part of the change. 
     <br><br>


Living in Newport Beach, a neighboring city to Pasadena, I can agree that there is a stigma for any transporting method not involving a personal vehicle, although it is even worse in my city. People in my hometown without their own car or even if they share a car with family members are looked at as less popular. Worse, I admittingly have speed past busses and cut them off for being slow. 

     <br><br>


Ads should not dictate how one should live their life. By effectively persuading audiences to buy their products, they trick people into perceiving that how the models hired act is the only right way to live your life. With television and social media such huge platforms for the transmission of information, I would really like to see more productive, important messages circling and trending, especially about climate change.
     <br><br>



With elections coming up, I have conflicting views of which candidates to support. However, when it comes down to it, someone running on the basis of environmental activism is going to make or break my decision. I have this class and this film to thank for that.





<br><hr>
As someone who also grew up in a upper-middle class Socal area, I totally agree with what you say here. I find it so admirable that Kalmus is so environmentally conscious of his actions. I couldn't even dream of riding bikes in my home city because the infrastructure to support it is basically nonexistent. I have almost never seen a bike lane in my entire life within the city and for those that do exist, it is extremely dangerous to do so. Of course, this kind of ties into last week's readings. The main way we can fix this issue is to change infrastructure. 
     <br><br>
Despite genuinely admiring Kalmus's efforts, I am still curious as to how effective individual change is in the grand scheme of things. Having 3,000 people spontaneously decide not to ride a plane seems slightly non influential when considering how many flights there are on a daily basis regardless. Anyways, I do still respect the efforts and attempt to follow suit. I know I can change, just doubtful if the rest of the general public will as well.

After watching the film "Being the Change", I thought that it was really interesting all of you can do in order to reduce your own personal carbon footprint. Something that I had never even heard about before was a car powered by vegetable oil. I thought this was extremely innovative, as it was something that I personally have never heard anything about it as well as being a way to still drive a car while having zero emissions. I think that the vegetable oil powered car should be something that is publicized more, because I think that one of the biggest reasons why people don't change their ways is because they do not know of any alternatives that they can use that will not require them to change their lifestyle a great deal. I also found that something that was really appealing about the lifestyle that Peter and his family live is how much money it can save. Most people believe that in order to have a household that is environmentally friendly it requires to spend a lot of money, but as I watched the movie I realized that this was not the case. Unfortunately many people are misguided and don't think that they can live a lifestyle where they are minimizing their carbon footprint.  I feel like although this is not a realistic lifestyle for everyone, a lot of people would be willing to adapt to this if they knew how to do it. I hope that this way of living can get more attention and people start changing their ways in order to create a real change in our environment.

I had a very similar reaction to watching this film. It amazes me that there are so many different ways that each of us can make an impact to help with the climate crisis. I am very grateful that Ken shows us so many of these films so that we are exposed to all of these different ways that we can change our lifestyles for the better. There are so many things that I have never even thought of as being more environmentally conscious, before taking this class. Peter is very inspiring in this film and he truly makes me feel like I can make a huge difference and completely change my lifestyle.

At first I was a little confused while watching this film; however, I realized that through Peter’s journey I was able to see his awareness about the impact of his actions on the planet and his willingness to reduce his carbon footprint. It is fair to say that he sets a very good example of an environmental activist and definitely motivates me to find zero CO2 emission alternatives and live a more sustainable life. Peter seems to look out for future generations, which I think is important because our actions are going to be reflected on our kids and grandchildren. As one of the guests in the films said,  “politicians should act in the best interest of future generations”.  To elaborate on that, we seem to forget about the lives that are being affected by our growing economy and our consumerism lifestyle and the state of the planet we are leaving behind us. Peter mentioned several times that personal actions lead to collectivism and he seems to hope for the best. I believe that we must change the bad habits that we are in control of and progressively advocate to educate others about climate change and how they can contribute to it. Peter went from 20 tons to 2 tons of CO2 emissions by starting with one change at a time, thus just like him we can set daily goals that over time will change our cultural practices and may end up enriching our life. We cannot allow ourselves to depend on materialistic stuff to bring happiness to our lives, and as mentioned in the film, material stuff can vanish in an instant.   
<br><Br>
Furthermore, I hope that this becomes a remarkable era and the beginning of “a profound change” because at this point we NEED to change to a more sustainable way of living.

yes yes yes. Smart legend. I love your take on this. Peter's journey was quite inspiring. To go from such a high emission rate of CO2 to such a low rate is truly amazing, and shows that we all have the power to lessen our carbon footprint. The one key takeaway I've had from this class for sure is that I need to lower my carbon footprint. I have already begun my journey and am proud of it. Progress is possible. We just have to believe in ourselves and each other, and take action.
<br><hr>
When watching the film "Being The Change" I also noticed how Peter was able to create a major reduction in his emissions not by making a single change in his life, but rather by making a series of small changes in his daily habits. For example,  Peter says that over 4 years he made changes such as forgoing flying, growing much of his own food, using a bike instead of a car for transportation, and choosing not to eat meat. In the end, these changes combined to reduce his emissions by more than 10x what they were just 4 years prior. To me, this shows us that it is possible for us all to make a similar reduction in our own carbon footprint, if we just decide to slowly change the destructive habits we take part in every day.
 <br><Br>

Additionally, I also feel with the effects of climate change continuing to worsen, we truly do NEED to move to more sustainable ways of living in order to have a chance at saving our species and planet. No longer can we afford to continue the excessive, materialistic lifestyles many of us inhabit. In my opinion the way out of these lifestyles is not with more technological progression, but rather by realizing that our reliance on technology has actually been a catalyst for the climate crisis that we find ourselves in today. As Peter states in the film "the burning of fossil fuels has really fueled this myth of progress...that we can do anything with technology." In my opinion, we need to stop believing in this "myth" and follow the lead of people like Peter who have gone against our need to constantly progress, and have actually found greater happiness in doing so. To me, the additional happiness that Peter and others have felt through living more sustainable lives should be a great motivator for those who are considering making similar changes in their own lives. We all want to be happier, so why not begin to take the steps towards sustainability in order to achieve this?
<br><hr>
I definitely relate to how you felt when the film first started. I also felt a bit confused as to what the film was about, because it was very different compared to the other films we’ve seen throughout this course. It wasn’t the type of film to just spit out the facts about climate change and what we should do to stop it. Instead, it actually showed people who were doing this. It shows more on how an American family can live sustainably, while also living a normal, if not better life than the average American family. I definitely agree with you that Peter is an excellent example of his awareness on the impact and the willingness he has to reduce his carbon footprint. What really surprised me was how genuinely happy he seemed as opposed to the average family that looks nothing of the such. I wish I had his willingness, because even though I do care about the environment, I just don’t think I’d be able to make the effort to reduce my carbon footprint to 1/10 of that of the average American. I couldn’t make the switch and in such a short time. Everything these days seems to revolve around technology, which depends on energy, most of which is renewable. When I saw the way that family was living, it made me think that they were going back in time. I hardly saw any technology being used at Peter’s home. It almost makes me think that the only way to live sustainably is by giving up the precious technology that are generations have put so much time, effort, and thought into making for the betterment of society. 
  <br><Br>

I also hope that this becomes the era of remarkable change, because that is definitely something that we need now. In essence, everybody has to start somewhere, and it’s never too late to make that change, but it’s definitely preferred that that change be now lol. One good idea that I believe would be a good step in the right direction would be to reduce the amount of food that we waste, because 40% of all the food produced in the U.S. ends up not being eaten, and I definitely don’t believe this should be too difficult for society to improve upon. I really enjoyed this quote when the idea of dumpster-diving was brought up: “The idea is not to go dumpster-diving. The idea is ‘Let’s not put any food in the dumpsters in the first place’.” I also believe that more people around the world need to be educated on this subject matter. For example, it was said in the film when the idea of humanure was implemented in Nicaragua, that the people didn’t even know that existed. If only, more people, especially the ones from less-developed countries, were to be educated would the world be a much better place relative to the way it is right now. And finally, we also have to alter the relationship we have towards materialistic things. As stated in the film, “Global warming is a direct result of wanting more…”, and I completely agree. Nowadays, everyone wants to know what it’s like to live the “American Dream”, where people believe that having more stuff makes you happy, when in fact it’s the opposite. I believe that people like Peter are the ones that will cause the beginning of a movement for the betterment of the environment, and all it takes is one person to get the ball rolling.

I felt the same way when watching this film. For the first ten minutes or so, it seemed like the documentary was more about self-improvement than climate change. Yet after watching the film in its entirety, I see why Peter took this approach with the style of the film. By introducing his wife and kids, talking about his meditation journey and mentors, and showing various different local initiatives/businesses doing their part, he was trying to show how positive living sustainably really could be. In addition to that, I think the way the film was organized was really thoughtful, emphasizing how individual actions could spark movements from the grassroots up. I think this was a very useful rhetorical strategy, rather than sparking guilt and sorrow in the viewers, he instead elicited feelings of hope and even love. I personally really enjoyed this film, and I think it would bring anyone joy to watch, regardless of their current interest in the climate crisis. What I loved most about Being The Change is how optimistic and passionate Peter is about the issue. Being a former physicist and current climate scientist, I'm sure he has experienced a great deal of frustration with the inaction of our government. Yet he decides to take action, regardless of how small his personal impact might make, because he truly believes in the power of the people. This is something quite beautiful to me that will stick with me when I look back at this class.

I think your take on the purpose of this film is exactly correct. I was also a little confused in the beginning about why we were watching this film. Although, towards the end, it became clear that Peter’s story is meant to inspire us to start taking small actions towards a more sustainable lifestyle, as you said. I think that the film was made in such a purposeful way as to not overwhelm the audience. Instead of starting off by portraying Peter as an extreme environmentalist, as some of the other documentaries we’ve watched have, it instead took us through his journey of what he would coin “the head, hands, and heart”. It started with him coming to the understanding that action needs to be taken regarding the climate, or at the very least personal action. Then showed us how he implemented changes into his life such as his vegetable oil-powered car, his compost pile, and even how his kids and wife walk or bike a mile to school every day. Lastly, it became clear that Peter and his family now got more fulfillment and joy out of their new lifestyle than they had had before. 

  <br><Br>

One comment that Peter made in the film that was a little humorous to me was when he explained that he didn’t think of himself as being an extreme environmentalist at all, but instead, he’s on the “middle path” in terms of the actions he could be taking. While watching this film I felt that he wasn’t giving himself enough credit for the changes he’s already made. Personally, I wouldn’t call the new lifestyle he’s adapted the “middle path” at all. I don’t see many vegetable oil-powered cars driving around or people voluntarily using outdoor toilets. Although, at the same time, I would also argue that there are many more drastic actions that one could do. I would place Peter somewhere between the middle and high levels of environmental extremism. That said, my view could also depict the very phenomena that’s occurring in society. The phenomena I’m mentioning is society’s habit to make one change in their lifestyle, such as recycling more or switching to LED lightbulbs, and then feeling as if they’ve done their part to fight the climate crisis. While one change is appreciated, it’s not nearly enough to make an impact on the level of CO2 in the atmosphere or the rise in temperature globally. As a society, we need to unstick ourselves from this mindset and realize, as Peter has, that a pathway of changes needs to be followed in order to truly make an impact with personal action.


<br><hr>
I agree with you in the fact that many people should take Peter's advice and use his ideals to be motivated to change. The fact that he was able to cut his emissions to 1/10 of what they were is truly inspiring and makes the view want to change their ways as well. Many people may argue that their life wouldn't be as fulfilling, happy or meaningful. For one, we have to realize that sacrifice is the only way we are going to progress with the climate change issue. Major change requires major sacrifice. We can't expect to always get what we want and not expect to have to do something for it and it seems so many people have this mindset. For example, Peter mentions that he and his wife really wanted to have a third kid, but realizing that population increase was such a big contribution to climate change, they decided two was enough. This is a very selfless act because most people would say "it's just one more kid what does it really matter" or "some families are having 6 or more kids so why can't I just have one more." These arguments are similar to "if I don't go on this plane it's only one empty seat and the plane will still use the same amount of emissions." People don't see the bigger picture of if 1000 families agree to not have that third kid, that's 1000 less kids. Or like they said in the movie, if 300 people don't go on that flight that could be one less plane ride. And two, there were many parts of the documentary that shows how actively cutting down your carbon footprint can make your life MORE meaningful and happy. For example, the one mom walks her children to school everyday. That is 20 minutes of conversation and time with her family that I'm sure she and those kids will hold dear to their hearts forever. Plus it is great exercise which there is evidence that proves exercise increases brain function so those kids are probably going to do better in school and the mother is more successful at work.

I agree with you. Before watching this documentary, I never realized that if I choose a more healthy living way, how a large amount of carbon dioxide I can reduce. However, after watching this documentary, Peter clarified this. It is so inspiring for me to hear that he cuts nearly ten times carbon dioxide emissions by living in his way-forgetting about consumerism, having fewer babies, living in a small house. To be honest, from my perspective, I think the reason for why there are so many people in modern society who do not want to start from themselves to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide is because they think there is no benefit for themselves and also their own influence is so small that cannot influence the whole world. Just because of this kind of thought, few people want to start focusing on this problem. However, this documentary mentioned that it is false for people to think that there is no benefit; instead of it, people will get a massive amount of profits by doing this. Having fewer babies means that you can spend more time to accompany one child and participate in every step or stage of your child’s growth. Giving up consumerism will let people become happier more easily than before because they will not have the eternal yearning. Riding bicycles to someplace, like what Peter does in the documentary, can build up our bodies and reduce carbon dioxide at the same time. If these advantages can let more and more people know, I believe that it is an excellent strategy to encourage every person in the world to pay attention to this question. We can promote our living happiness and solve the problem of global warming at the same time.

I totally agree with you. One of the scenes in the movie that touched me the most is that Peter said he used to live in an apartment in New York, where he “couldn’t even realize when it was raining.” I came from a city built mainly in cement and steel as well, and I can absolutely feel what it is like to feel disconnected to nature. Moving to Santa  Barbara, I fell in love with this place at first sight because of the fine weather and the vibrant ocean.

However, this might no longer be the same for our grandchildren if we continue to sit and do nothing. Problems we created won’t be solved by just avoiding it. Most people do that. If they have the ability to move away from places with poorer living conditions, they won’t hesitate. But the people living in the three world countries and the generations after us have no choice but to live with these horrible weather we left.
  <br><Br>

Collectively, we can create the change we would like to see by ourselves. To elaborate, we can reduce our personal greenhouse gas emissions by doing simple things like fixing our machines instead of replacing them with new ones, and commute by bikes.

I was as well a bit confused at first when watching the film “Being the Change”. I found it very interesting and intriguing that we were able to see the different aspects of Peter's life and his determination to reduce his carbon footprint. In a sense, this film gave me hope. It shows us that it is easy and very effective to switch to a more sustainable life without having to make drastic changes. Instead, we can make small changes that eventually led up to an even bigger one. I found it important that Peter was conscious of future generations as well. A lot of people nowadays don’t think about the effects the climate crisis will have on our future children, grandchildren, etc. It was refreshing to see that Peter actually addressed the issue of future generations suffering due to our current actions. I found it inspiring that Peter was able to cut his carbon footprint from 20 tons to 2 tons of CO2 emissions. This goes to show that it is possible to make a personal change and will ultimately be effective in the long run. Although he is still emitting more than the average person in Bangladesh, he is putting out an effort to try and make a personal change and this is very effective. Peter started with small changes from biking to growing his own food to meditating. All these actions helped him slash his climate footprint by 1/10th and become happier in the process. I think Peter’s established happiness is important to note. Not only will living a more sustainable life help the environment in the long run, but it also has positive effects on people’s mental states and happiness. It allows us to have stress lifted from us and not worry about materialistic things in life. Peter successfully shows that taking direct action is extremely important and is ultimately the first step to success in fixing the climate crisis that we started.

I too felt a little bit confused when watching the movie “Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution.” This film is a prime example of people making individual lifestyle changes in hopes to create a ripple effect in their communities. As I was watching this, I was thinking to myself, “Why are we just watching this guy live his normal day to day life?” but then I noticed that that might be kind of the point. This film shows us that someone, like Peter and his family, can live very normal and fulfilling lives while still cutting down their carbon footprint. I couldn’t believe that he has 1/10 of a normal American’s carbon footprint. It was also very interesting to compare how I live my life compared to how Peter lives his and how much I really am not doing to help stop the climate crisis and how I need to change my life.


<br><hr>

I was also really confused about watching this film. It seemed like a lot of random information and clips brought together. Overall it honestly is probably my least favorite film Ken has assigned. But what did stand out to me was when they were talking about throwing things away, his question is "Where is away" and the answer is that there is no away. That really stuck with me because to throw things away is such a common idea that I never put much thought to. And global warming is truly just people constantly buying more and more things. And large companies are constantly feeding into this. They make us feel like we are in constant need to have the newest items, they encourage us to buy more and "throw out" our previous items. And as we have seen with fast fashion, these items do not just disappear. One thing I guess I would say I liked about the video was that Peter showed us that anyone, a typical family can reduce their CO emissions and that we do not have to be millionaires with solar panel roofs to make a difference. I still believe that the best things at this point in our life, everyone in this class, use our voice, be activist, be active in voting, and focus on changing ourselves.


<br><hr>

I agree that Peter's outlook definitely considers future generations. This is the type of mentality all people need to have. His head, hands, heart motto really put in perspective how to make this change. I think a lot of people are currently only at the head stage: understanding that climate change is a huge issue and something needs to be done to fix it. Watching films like this may motivate some, and as mentioned bring actual happiness rather than just phantom wealth through possessions. On the other hand, some may turn their nose up and think "oh god, I would never choose to go to the bathroom outside." I wish there was a way to make this change seem easier, but at this point the changes that need to be made are drastic and result in a complete lifestyle change.


<br><hr>
I agree with you, the film “ Being the Change” really shows Peter's journey of trying to be the change. At first i was definitely confused but then realized how much of an impact this film actually has. My thought was Peter is just a normal guy like all of us and is trying to understand how he can help save the planet from global warming. I believe this film really captures the impact of how one person reduced their carbon footprint from lifestyle changes. This should encourage all of us who are aspiring to be like Peter because he really showed us how much of an impact changing your carbon footprint can be. For everyone that wants to make a change like Peter did, the best way is to replicate what he did. To go from 20 to 2 tons of CO2 emissions is inspiring to all of us that want to make a change.



<br><hr>

I definitely agree that it was motivating to see someone sacrifice aspects of the widely accepted American way of life for the betterment of the planet. It had the precise effect that I suspect the producers wanted their documentary to have on the audience; directing attention towards others is not the way to inspire change, rather one should "be the change" and display the unforeseeable benefits and happiness that comes with an environmental conscious lifestyle. While I don't suspect I'll adopt the same lifestyle as Peter, I'll certainly be actively making necessary sacrifices for the sake of lowering my own and inspiring others to reduce their carbon footprint. One thing I'll remember in particular from this documentary is the Repair Cafe. It would be a lot of fun to visit the cafe and see it operating in person!


<br><hr>

I think your comment is great! I also think the fact that Peter actively looking out for future generations is very important as well. I appreciated how much Peter cared for his family in the film. He knew that he wanted to have kids but also recognized that there are more environmental costs. The climate crisis doesn't mean you have to give up everything you want/hope for, Peter accounted for what a family would mean in terms of his carbon footprint and made positive changes to balance it out. Him and his family seemed so happy. The film did an amazing job of showing the benefits of their lifestyle. Because the family chose to limit their car use, they made better use of their time by walking to school which meant they got to walk their dog, get exercise and spend quality time together. Overall the family seemed to be very happy and it made me optimistic in thinking about how I'll live with my family. Once people see the major benefits of living an environmentally conscious life, as seen in this film, hopefully they would want to make those changes too. 
  <br><Br>
I think out of everyone in the film, Pancho was my favorite. He embodies the true spirit of activism. He was so happy being able to give back, and I think there is no better success than happiness. Cultural/personal changes will not only limit the affects of climate change but will hopefully create a positive change in how we value ourselves and others.
<br><hr>

I agree with you, the film was confusing to me too, I honestly question what new thing was there to learn from this. Like you when he got to the part about his grease powered car, that got me interested because it’s carbon footprint would be zero.. This could be a great idea for cars that could be modified and better researched. Maybe cars can work on like vegetable oil, they could potentially find something new to power vehicles. 
  <br><Br>
Peter did look out for future generations especially his children, he took into consideration his children and I felt that's what made it more important for him to do. This same reason could be used for people to change their habits, the thought of their already born children and how they are the ones who will have to deal with their actions. The emphasis about voting made by the guest was good, politicians SHOULD be acting in future generations best interests. They pretty much work for us, we make the decisions by voting. 
  <br><Br>
Agreed, Peter went from 20 tons to 2 tons and his living situation isn’t even bad. We usually tend to think that if we change our habits we would be living miserably in like the most minimal of conditions but that's not true. The part about letting people you are reducing your emission I liked the most because I thought of it as an influencer kind of thing. When people see something as a like trend they will get on board to fit in. This also ties in into the material part because yes they bring happiness but in an instance everything could disappear.

I agree that Kalmus did a very good job at providing what a sustainable lifestyle would look like for the average American. I really liked how he stated how he wanted to have another kid, and used this as an opportunity to educate his children on how to live sustainably. His outlook on population and his alternatives to saving energy were interesting and inspiring because a human would want to "make it big" in life probably wouldn't be doing what he is. For instance, going out of my way to get vegetable oil waste from restaurants to use as car fuel is something I really don't see myself doing in the future, nor do I want an outdoor bathroom. However, I did find interest in the Humanure lifestyle proposed by Joseph Jenkins mainly because of how much energy he saves by composting human manure. Again, this is something I don't picture myself doing ten years from now, but it is definitely eye opening to see that there are Americans who are very passionate about this type of lifestyle and find joy in their sustainability. With this, I applaud Kalmus for his efforts and success in reducing his carbon footprint by 1/10, and for truly educating his children on this type of lifestyle as well. As you stated in your comment, collectivism stems from personal actions, and those personal actions must be seen and understood by others. This is how change can and will be met, and this change can truly lead to overall happiness and peace in life, which is clearly demonstrated by Kulmus. Kulmus meditates in his everyday life to gain two things: awareness and equanimity. At first, I didn't get how this relates to the climate crisis, but then I realized mediating creates the right headspace to become aware of situations at hand and how to go at them. Meditation can relate to creating change, as well as promote sustainable lifestyles. Americans/people must be aware of the situation at hand in the first place, meaning we must realize what the problem is, and that it is stemming from human actions. Then with equanimity, we mustn't allow judgement from others to get to our heads. With awareness and equanimity, humans can gain an overall sense of peace with how they are living their lives, which results in overall happiness.


<br><hr>

While watching "Being the Change," I found it inspiring how Peter Kalmus lives a life focused on reducing his carbon footprint, while also trying to find meaning in his life. I think he truly sets an example of ways to live in a friendly state toward the environment by making choices such as gardening and riding a bike. Meanwhile, another way that Peter Kalmus has connected with life and found purpose is by finding values through something like meditation. We should all learn from his example and that of other environmental leaders who are changing their ways to make the world a better place. As you said, this is a step-by-step process, that will ultimately change our course for the better. 
  <br><Br>
One part of your comment that I found very important was that you referred to future generations and said: "we seem to forget about the lives that are being affected by our growing economy and our consumerism lifestyle and the state of the planet we are leaving behind us." Our generation and the ones in the future need us, and at the moment it feels like we have failed them and won't be able to preserve the planet. Yet, I have hope that there is still time to change our path and create a new future where the earth is habitable.


<br><hr>

I totally agree with your statement on how Peter was able to reduce his carbon footprint by changing up his lifestyle one thing at a time. I would also like to add that it honestly was inspiring to me that even though he was making all these really big lifestyle choices, he was still happy and so was his family. This just goes to show how living with a very small carbon footprint is possible in the United States and how someone can still have a great life while on it.
   <br><Br>

I also want to add how the film talked about the changes he had made, and how the changes would become easier over time. I for one have no idea how you would change the fuel of a car from gasoline to vegetable oil, but I like how that if more people switch, these transitions will have more people helping you so it will become easier to change your lifestyle.


<br><hr>

I agree with you in which it is fair to say that he sets a very good example of an environmental activist and has motivated me to become more Co2 aware and live a more sustainable life. I was also slightly confused at the beginning of the film with the direction it was going to go in, but I think he did a great job at getting his point across on the steps we need to take in order to contribute to combating climate change. I noticed that Peter looks out for the younger generations because he has younger kids and I think this is very important as he is able to raise young activists. One of the guests said in the film that yes, it is more environmentally friendly to have no kids, but if you do have kids just make sure you raise them as a world changer. This quote stuck with me because Peter is able to do this in his film with his young kids. They are being raised in a type of environment that is sustainable. If, when we start having kids, we are able to educate them in the ways that Peter did to his we would not only be living a more sustainable life, but more people would be knowesgate on the issue of the climate crisis and more change would be done. We have a long journey ahead of reducing co2 emissions and changing the way we live our lives, but I think that Peter is helping make a dent in his own emissions and through educating people of what needs to be done.


<br><hr>
Yes, I agree. Peter is the person who has faith. He has the ability to earn more money, to spend more, and to have a "better" life. However, the current life is the best life for him. People have different identification for a good life. The perspective of different people is not mutual understanding. Thus, as long as a person have his own faith and truly trust it in his world, he will have the best life. The bad part of this kind of happiness is the faith may be too fragile. If Peter only cares about his own lifestyle and the people who believed him, he will have a happy life. However, if he tried to persuade all of the people to have the same lifestyle, he will have more influence and more trouble. He may say the cruelty of the world. 
   <br><Br>

I have a similar lifestyle as him. I am not saying the reducing emission of CO2 part. I am saying to live in my own world. There is no significance in the world. We all need to build up to something and persuade us to believe it is meaningful.



<br><hr>
When I saw what inspired Peter’s journey, I was wondering if it could be applied to everyone. Once his son was born, he decided to do whatever it took to help ensure a future for them on this planet because Peter said he didn’t even know if they could have a future due to climate change. I love how his lifestyle is based on what is good for his family and ultimately everyone who lives on this planet. I think it is a respectable move that he did because I know that most parents love their children but can they change their whole lifestyle just to ensure that there will be a future for their kids? I remember there was one person in the film that said the best thing you could do for the planet is to not have kids or if you choose to, you will have to cut back your carbon emission because Earth is already at its maximum for the human population. Before he said that, I always thought that if you can’t provide for the child, you probably shouldn’t have one but what he’s saying is that if you can choose, don’t have a child for the ecological benefits for the Earth. I think what he said was reasonable because the human population is exponentially growing at a fast pace and there aren’t enough resources based on how we are living today to provide for them but I just never would have thought about the situation if he didn’t say that. 

   <br><Br>

I think what Peter’s action is admirable because he is literally cutting his carbon emission by 90% and this all started for his children. I also agree with taking small steps at a time in order to reduce our carbon emission. I know it would be hard to cut 90% within a year when it took Peter a while but if we all do something small each day, it will have somewhat of a benefit.



<br><hr>

 I agree with you; we need to start taking ownership of our actions and how we as a society have contributed to the climate crisis thus far. I think the most important messages/takeaways from this film (both of which you explained in your original comment) are how our actions are influenced by our cultural practices and our fondness of materialistic things. We definitely need to stray away from this idea in order to pursue a greener way of living.
<br><hr>

Yes! The fact that Peter changed his life from 20 tons of CO2 emissions to just 2 is absolutely astonishing. I greatly appreciate how Peter used a collection of innovative ways to make these changes possible. Peter is literally goals. I am a huge fan of how he makes all these changes seem completely possible. I am also a huge fan of how this documentary paints things in a positive light. In contrast to the other films we have watched this quarter, this film was super wholesome and happy. I enjoyed watching Peter and his family show off how the various changes that they have made in their lifestyle and I am super appreciative of the many sacrifices that they have made. It's an incredible change and it takes huge guts to follow through with it. You are absolutely 100% correct. We need to make change in order to live sustainably. I also hope that this is the beginning of a remarkable era.


<br><hr>

Sometimes I've found that making all the changes that we need to take to reduce our carbon footprint that we've listed in the class to be very overwhelming. Like how are we supposed to make such drastic changes in our lifestyle so quickly?? Seems kinda chaotic. In the documentary "Being The Change," Peter was able create a massive reduction in his emissions by tackling each necessary change as it came. I found this documentary to be quite relieving in the sense to see that an average family was able to change their habits and reduce their overall carbon footprint. It wasn't a documentary that spit out the facts and information, leading the viewer self-reflect and feel guilty; more so, it was a documentary that showed how fulfilling a sustainable life can be. Not only were they changing their food habits and the way they commuted, they were engaging in meditation and building the community.They were the change they wanted to see in the world. The transformation to a more sustainable lifestyle for this family took over four years. Certainly the changes we need to take aren't going to overnight... it will take some time. But with that being said, we need to take action now.


<br><hr>

I too was a little confused in the beginning of the film, it seemed as if Ken wanted us to watch a movie on meditation. But it made sense, when one simplifies their life they are able to enjoy the finer things in life. What I liked about the film was how it highlighted Peter's education being a huge part of his life. Most feel that their status and wealth are shown in the possessions that they have, but Peter shows that even in a household where both parents have Ivy League education, that status and wealth doesn't always equate to success or happiness. I really admired their willingness to change their lifestyles and inspire others to do the same, and I liked how Peter mentions that this didn't have to be an all or nothing change. He wants to cut out as much carbon in his life and be as environmentally conscious as possible, but he doesn't want it to be so restrictive. Having children was something that was very important to him, so he didn't just choose to not have kids, but he chose to cut back in the excess of life that wasn't adding any value so he could have more of what he truly wanted in his life. 

   <br><Br>

The fact that Peter was able to cut back on carbon substantially is admirable and something I would someday like to do. I  actually calculated my carbon footprint online and saw that four planets would be needed to sustain my lifestyle... there are definitely major changes that need to be made in my life. But I liked how Peter suggested to make those changes. Make one small change a week, like cutting back on dairy, and soon those changes will make for radical change.


<br><hr>

I agree, in the beginning I was a little confused on the purpose of the film but by the end it made sense. It was inspiring how Peter made changes in his lifestyle to become more environmentally friendly. Many of the changes were things that we can all do in our lives to do our part to solve the climate crisis. It was interesting to see the development as the film progressed of how once a person realizes the issues that face our planets and their part in them, that real change can be made at a personal level. It goes to show that if more people are educated on the climate crisis and see that there are alternatives to how they are currently living their lives, real cultural change may be possible.


<br><hr>
I also thought the film started off a little odd and/or confusing with all the stuff on meditation, his children, etc. Because I couldn’t understand at first how this related to what I thought was gonna be basically an updated Inconvenient Truth. But I was wrong. I liked how they showed us that by being more aware, by meditating, by being deliberate and conscious in our daily lives, we could then make better choices in how we want to personally combat climate change. It’s an important lesson in my opinion because if we can get ourselves right and live healthily, making those decisions such as riding a bike, or eating less meat, or lowering our carbon footprint become easier. 
   <br><Br>
I also loved Ed Bagley Jr. in the film. He’s been doing this since he was 20 years old, which again is relatable to many of us now in school. I also liked when Peter brought up to him that he couldn’t afford a lot of the things Ed had been doing that Ed said: “Neither could I, when I started in 1970.”  He had to do one small thing at a time until he got to where he is now. It’s not always about everything all at once. Sometimes it’s just about changing what we can now, and just making sure we keep doing that in a healthy way that eventually leads to a huge difference in our personal lives. This was nice to hear because it makes it easier and more palatable for us as college students to start small and work our way up. Because sometimes it can feel rather daunting changing so much so fast.



<br><hr>
I agree with you that Peter Kalmus is an excellent example of modern environmental activists. I respect his passion and his progress in reducing to 1/10 of the average American carbon footprint. He focused on intrinsic motivation, such as meditation, as a way to helps depression and seek positivity and solutions in life. He also involves gardening, fixing, biking and serving, which allows him to laugh with people. In his way to reducing emissions, he gained much more community experience and friends that bring him full of joy. He decides not to fly and drives on waste vegetable oil. Personal actions are essential for collective efforts. If more people and we engage and choose to change the routine of their life, there could be a considerable change as collective actions. We could reduce the amount of carbon emission efficiently with a happier life, but it is a matter of whether we have the motivation or determination to do it. I believe that as more and more people change into a green lifestyle, people will see the trend and begin to change.



<br><hr>

I think a lot of people see this transition to a more sustainable life as radical or impossible. But as Peter Kalmus has shown us, this transition doesn't have to be radical , it't the small daily goals that are more important. When people hear " we need to change our lifestyles to a more sustainable one" I think a lot of people assume that their entire life is going to change all of a sudden - which is just not true. For example, a meat consumer could start off by incorporating turkey or chicken in their diet, and as time goes by, they'll no longer consume meat in unsustainable quantities. Perhaps you could make it a goal to ditch your car and ride the bus 3 days out of the week, or even ride your bike. Not only would you be getting in a bit more of physical activity but you'd be helping the environment. 
   <br><Br>
I really do wish the U.S. would prioritize mass transit instead of cars and car infrastructure. That is why it is crucial to vote in all levels of government , and not let the automobile industry or any industry for that matter to prioritize their profits over our environment and well being.


<br><hr>
While I have some issues with the way that the film was done, I can still appreciate and commend it's message, Peter's initiative, and his family's way of life. I like that Peter believes that personal actions lead to collectivism, I agree with him. For instance, I can remember when I first heard about people going vegan, I was probably eight years old, it seemed strange and people were alienated for it, but now– though I am aware not everywhere– people seem to commend vegans and more and more people become vegans or join in on eating vegan. I think that taking steps to reduce your carbon footprint should be on everyone's mind, on everyone's todo list– but if other people don't join in it is less likely that new people will begin to, almost like a money see, monkey do situation. Needless to say, there is a big social aspect to any movement, environmentalism included, and changing individual habits has the potential to for a ripple effect throughout society. 
   <br><Br>
I find Peter's ability to maintain a normal suburban lifestyle while having such a low footprint to be incredible, and it takes a lot of work– it made me realize that it shouldn't be considered strange for people to want to life that way and it should definitely not be so hard to do so. There is a strange paradox that exists in our society: that you have to try the hardest to pollute the least. It is very strange that carbon is so ingrained in our society that a such a substantial amount of effort has to be made so that you can have a low footprint. Something needs to be done about that, unfortunately I don't really know what.



<br><hr>
I thought that this film was a nice change from the usually assigned content. The fact that it was so personal made it, for me, more hopeful. It wasn't a bunch of climate scientists telling us we need to make changes now or we're doomed, though that can be effective. But it was refreshing to get a personal, detailed story on how Peter got to the point where he felt the need for change, and how he went about it. I liked how he talked about being in a middle ground, because it's far more realistic that way. People who believe they can just go straight to zero emissions aren't being reasonable, so it was nice to see him making compromises so that he wouldn't have to live uncomfortably, but he was still reducing his emissions by a ton. 
   <br><Br>
Peter truly is looking out for future generations and I applaud him for that. It's clearly something most people aren't doing, specifically politicians, until recently at least. It's more about the future now than ever, as we're actually starting to see the signs of climate change, meaning that it's only going to get worse, and now is the time for action. With the upcoming elections, we as the future generation need to make sure our voice is heard loud and clear when it comes to our stance on climate change. I've personally been looking more into politicians and their stance on climate change as one of my top interests so that I can be proud of the vote I cast.



<br><hr>
I also loved the fact that he changed his life one step at a time instead of trying to make one grand shift. This makes it seem like it is a much more attainable goal and is also reflective on how society will have to make a gradual shift both mentally and with its infrastructure. I will note that some of the changes that he made are not possible in certain areas and many people do not have the education to implement many of the changes that he was able to make on his own. 
   <br><Br>


I fully agree that we are at a point where this sort of behavior should be normalized or even viewed as something to aspire to. I think if most people in the USA were to walk into this mans backyard or have to shadow him for a day they would detest every second of it, and immediately go back to their every day life, resisting change, which again is an argument for gradual change.



<br><hr>

I felt the same way when watching the film “Being the change”. I never realized that an individual could has any influence on the emission of greenhouse gas due to the tiny force. Nevertheless, after watching the film, it turns out even an individual could play a predominant part in reducing climate change in that Peter, the main character in the film “Being the change”, proves that one could reduce carbon emissions from 20 tons to 2 tons within a four year by making tiny changes and adjustments towards his daily life. I was shocked and felt incredible initially when Peter mentioned his masterpiece in the film. However, giving the changes devoting by Peter, which includes having fewer children, changing his attitudes towards consumerism and living in a small house, it is reasonable for him to cut almost 10 times carbon dioxide emissions. Peter’s deeds ignite our hope to control the increase temperature within 2 degrees celsius since his deeds proves that as long as individuals are willing to make those tiny changes, we could possess a better environment! Some may argue that it is not easy for one to change his used lifestyle. But  one should not always be self-centered, please consider your children and your grandchildren. Once we refuse to make any changes from now, the innocent future generation may well encounter the ravage by the natural world!


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment, at first I also found this film a bit confusing. Peter does a great job at raising awareness for the climate crisis, and I admire how he is eager to find solutions to this issue. I also like how he set his goals and accomplished them by changing his lifestyle. This was very inspiring and is meant to motivate us that this is possible if we give it a chance. He had a great change in his lifestyle and even seeked having more happiness just by reducing all these unnecessary things in our lives. Like you mentioned, if we stop focusing on the materialistic things in life, we not only help the planet, but we also create a positive change in our lives. It'll help us value what we have more and achieve great happiness in our lives. The film overall has made me feel that I can start making changes as well in my life.



<br><hr>
Just like you, I was a little confused while watching this film probably because I didn’t read the book. There is little explanation given up in front of us who Peter is and what he is doing. However, as the documentary goes on, I learned that this movie shows how a typical American family lives their life without burning fossil fuels. They prove to us that it is possible to live without fossil fuels and even better. This movie explains how Peter and his family reduced their carbon emission to one-tenth of the average American. They did so by riding bikes, ditching air travel, growing their own food, becoming vegetarian, and more. All of these things are discussed in the book, but seeing them in the movie makes them more real. Nowadays, people are obsessed with technology and believe technology could solve any problems. In the movie, the Peter family challenges this belief by using a traditional, low cost, and less tech-driven method to reduce climate footprint. He doesn’t choose to install solar panels or drive electric cars. He doesn’t criticize such methods, but he shows the audience that one doesn’t need to be rich to make a difference. I think this is a very important point. Some people are not willing to take action because they think they don’t have the ability to do so or even if they do so, it is not a big deal to the world. As Peter's friend Rob Greenfield says, "Individual action is every bit as important as a collective action. Together, we can make the world different.



<br><hr>

I connected with this comment a lot because I too felt confused when watching this film, but after thinking about afterward realized what the message was really about.  I really enjoyed that Peter went one by one in reducing his carbon footprint instead of saying that it should be done all at once because, in my opinion, slow but steady progress is the only way that we are going to get the public to change for the better of the planet.  "Politicians should act in the best interest of future generations" is a great quote because it is so true.  That should be what politicians strive to accomplish, but instead, it is all about reelection and keeping the corporations that donate towards their campaign satisfied.  It is a sad truth, but it ultimately on the people for keeping those that don't promote Climate activism in office.  This is off-topic, but March 3rd is election day it voting is one of the most, if not the most important, action to take to help stop the Climate Crisis.  Anyways I really the more I think back on the film the more I like the message it gave about personal action and what we can to the environment.  I also hope that this is the end of the CO2 emitting era where Oil companies control Congress and Carbon Dioxide is rapidly making our earth a dangerous place to live.  And out of the era comes a new era of eco-friendly change and a complete switch to Climate-friendly transportation, housing and agriculture.


<br><hr>

Jessica, like you, I was also very confused about how “Being the Change” was relevant. I actually even checked if I was watching the correct video multiple times. However, once Peter started going into the specifics of his more sustainable lifestyle, I saw the value in the documentary. This isn’t just the story of how he changed his mindset, this documentary provides specific solutions that he and his family have taken to reduce their climate footprint.
   <br><Br>
I think that above anything else, this documentary can inspire collectivism regarding the climate crisis. By showing an example of the simple lifestyle changes that Peter and his family have taken, it almost makes this reduction of climate footprint seem easy. Simple changes like using vegetable oil to power his car or creating a compost section in his backyard have greatly enabled him to reduce his impact on the environment. Like we have discussed the past couple of weeks, personal actions may feel insignificant in terms of the global carbon footprint, the inspiration that they could provide to others is where their true significance lies.
   <br><Br>
This documentary is important because it brings the proposed solutions that we have discussed to life. These are no longer just hypotheticals, and by showing their audience that these solutions can viably be implemented, the argument for climate activism becomes much stronger.  By following Peter’s example, the audience is able to make the same impact that he is making on the environment. And although most will not take their lifestyle changes to the same extremes that he did, even small personal changes for many people will make a difference in our climate impact.


<br><hr>

This film gave me a sense of hope, too. Peter was very optimistic and convincing that even though his actions led to a large decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, we all can do similarly. Rather than trying to implement many radical lifestyle changes very quickly, we can slowly change the way we live. In addition to our lifestyle changes, we need to show others how important it is to not eat meat, drive and fly as little as possible, etc. This would show a larger audience the realities of the climate crisis and hopefully put people on board for limiting their emission.


<br><hr>
Within the first five minutes of watching this film I felt very strange. I applauded that Peter was able to find ways and resources that allowed him to mesh living a "normal" life with one that was completely "environmental", and implementing his spirituality from that.  At first I felt very strange about the film, because it felt very extreme to me. Being from LA, in my mind, I thought there was no way for a person (let alone a family) to live in a mostly environmental way. But after actually seeing how he did it and how well he was able to combine the two together, it gave me hope that it can be done by more people. I enjoyed watching how his family was able to live comfortably and his kids were able to experience an enjoyable while not minimizing but living more naturally as he put it. This film gave me a new insight on how easy sustainable living could be if we actually put in the effort and work for it.



<br><hr>
I was also a bit confused as to why we were assigned to watch this film. However, it became pretty why after we were shown how Peter and his family make sustainable choices in their lives. After sitting in lecture for the past 8 weeks and reading and watching the material for this course, it is clear that making a change to a sustainable way of living is desperately needed if I want to see a change in the world. For instance, since the first couple of lectures, I have incorporated more plant-based meals into my diet. I have not cut out meat entirely as I still do consume chicken and fish, but I make the effort for at least one of my meals each day to be a plant-based meal.
   <br><Br>

Aside from this, watching Peter show us that living a sustainable life is possible in a family setting made me hopeful for the future. Peter mentioned in the film that individual action was just as important as collective action. This part stuck with me. I feel that oftentimes I am discouraged with my individual choices (eat a plant-based meal, thrift my clothes, etc.) when I look at the large population of people who do not make an effort. However, it is clear to me at how the individual is just as powerful as the whole. This film has inspired me to reevaluate my life again and see where I can switch to a sustainable lifestyle.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that this film, “Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution,” that Peter is a good example of the change we need in the midst of the climate crisis. His drive and optimism in reducing his carbon footprint is what leaders in this movement need to do. Peter even went as far as not having a third kid in order to not contribute to the overpopulation epidemic. His activism sets a good example for his kids and shows the influence parents have on their kids lives and how they pave the way for the important ideas children can gain from good parental influences. Peter makes a good point that change starts with the head, moves to the hands, and is finalized by the heart. I couldn't agree with this philosophy more, you need to accept it before you can start your action and you can't have the action without having meaning and drive in your heart. Peter makes a good point that materialism won’t lead to happiness and follows many of the minimalism movements ideals. Peter lives a life I respect and would like to lead for myself and my children.



<br><hr>

From my perspective, it’s common to hear people using some excuse like “an individual’s effort is too small to be counted” when they refuse to do anything to reduce their carbon footprint. These excuses are proved to be false by what Peter did in the movie; individuals’ efforts and acts actually are important and can make a huge change. Every big plan should start with a small initial goal and gradually enlarge it. I’m sure this works way better than setting a big, unachievable goal at the beginning and never able to make it. When individual powers get together, they become a stronger entirety and can easily make it to what we want to achieve. We really need to think about the following younger generations. We have the responsibility to leave them a sustainable, livable planet for them instead of a planet with a harsh environment and barely no resources. I would say it’s never too late to do something, and nothing should be considered as “too small to make a change”.



<br><hr>
I agree with your statement. At first the film threw me off with its intro on mediation , and was starting to get a bit skeptical on the type of information that was being conveyed. As the documentary continued, everything became much more clear. By including aspects of inner happiness, there are a lot of Buddhist ideas present. I found the message effective. I agree with the documentary in its argument on how inner peace and happiness is the true solution to the climate crisis. If we as a society learn how to become satisfied, we would be able to see the stupidity in our actions of over consumption and consumer culture.



<br><hr>
I totally understand what you’re saying and even looked at it through a different lens while I was watching the film. While I was watching the film I truly had to consciously keep my mind open to what I was watching; although the lifestyle of peter was not what I was normally exposed to I had to ask myself, “Although it’s not the orthodox way of living, why can’t it be?” Then I realized there’s no answer as to why everyone can’t change their lives and structure it so that the normal and societally accepted actions are also greenhouse gas friendly. It was truly inspiring as it was a perfect example of what we were learning in earlier weeks regarding personal action leading to collectivism, and this film did just that. It showed how an individual can have so much faith in that notion that he preaches it that much. Sometimes, the best leader isn’t telling people what to do, in this case telling them how to reduce, but rather leading by action, or in this case, enacting the very methods people use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

<br><hr>
To be honest I was also confused when starting this film and thought it contained less content than previous films, but when finishing the film I was able to see how this film was just as thought provoking as films that had more action per say. This film talked about a topic that many people consider to be the most important thing in life, happiness. It is true that people will have to give up many things in order to emit an acceptable level of C02 so the question is can people be happy while doing this. This film of the life of an average sized family showed just that. A family where the parents and kids still led fulfilling lives but using 10% of an average family's C02 emissions. Peter was fun in the way that he tried many different methods of reducing his carbon footprint, one of which was the humanure. Though this is not something I would personally try it is cool to see how dedicated he is to the cause and if all Americans just did half of what he was doing, there would be major benefit for the environment.

<br><hr>
I understood that the goal of the documentary was to argue against the common response which was about how an individual cannot have a large impact. It wasn't 100% about the impact but the happiness that can be achieved from doing such a noble deed. I realize as I get older that these documentaries about finding a better more fulfilling life are actually quite influential and can really make you think about the importance of finding your own personal happiness. As a kid I always saw it as unimportant however, I realize now that doing something like that is quite noble and important. Peter seems really worried about the future after he had kids and really wanted to do whats best for the next generation. Peter seems happy and content, without always looking to gain more things, he seemed to be preminimialistic. It's very interesting to see how people find their on happiness like the meditation or simply using a cleaner car. It used happiness instead of stress to convince people to live a cleaner life which is a new feeling as many documentaries seem to use a stressful tone in their convincing tactics


<br><hr>

Much of what you commented made a lot of sense to me and I agree that most of these issues are rooted in our societal view of climate and how we determine happiness. The focus on happiness is something that I really admired and really through into deep thought. I began to reevaluate what were the things that made me happy and what society wanted me to believe made me happy. From this revaluation of myself I found that the true things that make me happy are not materialistic and instead are interactions with others and helping them out. Of course this requires using materials such as I love to hear music with friends and that of course wouldn't be possible without my phone or electricity. Although those things are in the picture of what makes me happy, I believe I can then accommodate to being more environmentally friendly about it. This can be very hard when the media and the whole world is telling you that the feeling of happy comes from the purchasing of an item. We see commercials of people receiving the newest iPhone and the joy that comes on their faces, and so we then associate the feeling of happy with that of purchasing something and therefore contributing even more to our carbon footprint. A "profound change" like you mentioned does need to happen and soon. Hopefully through classes like these teaching us about climate change we can then pass it on to others and start a change there.

<br><hr>
Like yourself, I was also a bit confused while watching the film. However, as the film continued, I realized that what Peter was doing was setting an example of a more sustainable lifestyle. By demonstrating how he was able to make adjustments within his life in order to be more environmentally friendly, Peter is encouraging others to follow in his footsteps. This is important because we need the cooperation of the majority of people to effectively combat climate change. As you pointed out, politicians do play an essential role in how our society handles climate change. Politicians need to realize that climate change affects everyone and that there will be a point of no return soon if we continue to not take drastic measures. Like mentioned before, we need the majority of the public to become environmentally conscious and how can we expect them to make voluntarily lifestyle changes if the leaders of their country do not. Therefore, it is important that we educate the general public on climate change and adjustments that they can make in their lives just like Peter does in the film.

Being the change was an distinctly effective film because of its focus on the individuals. While political change and activism are fundamental elements to improve our impact on the planet, it’s important to recognize the individual's in all of this. Following the journeys of those in the film and seeing how they’re adapting their lifestyles for the benefit of earth inspires individual change more so than the other films in my opinion. Rather than advocating a movement that may bring change with enough support in the future, this film made me reflect on my own immediate lifestyle and impact. I think the science of climate change, while indisputable, is difficult for the ordinary person to fully understand how it relates to their practical and everyday lives. Seeing a film like this where the focus is put on the daily life of an environmental activist allowed me to view climate change in a more personal and intrinsic perspective. 
   <br><Br>

When climate change is discussed, it’s often from a macro perspective that many people can’t fully grasp. The discussion often comes down to policy and what countries can do to reduce its effects. However, since climate change affects everyone in a personal way, there should be more discussion on how individuals can expect to change their current lifestyles. I think the film does an excellent job at this, showing how activism shapes relationships and communities.

The documentary “being the change” changes my perspective on being an environmentalist. I used to associate having a sustainable lifestyle as having a less fulfilling life. Seeing Peter and his family’s lifestyle shows me that being sustainable can also give you fulfillment and happiness. I like how they take advantage of everything they can do to lessen their carbon emission. For example, they pick fruits that are otherwise going to be wasted to give out to their community to solve dumpster diving. When Peter explains that by driving a car powered by vegetable oil, he is not adding any more CO2 to the atmosphere, I feel so inspired. He shows me that if I want to be sustainable, I don’t have to just go from driving to walking or biking and stop enjoying the benefit of driving. There is an alternative. Knowing that there are ways to live a sustainable life while still being able to enjoy the benefit of modern technology gives me hope.

I agree with your comment. I really enjoyed that they were introducing this idea to me that living a sustainable lifestyle isn’t so much about what you’re giving up, but also the happiness that is being added to your life. I loved the projects they did with giving back. They planted and picked fruits that most people would be excited to make profit out of, but instead of selling them, they gave them to their community, no strings attached. I also enjoyed watching the guy that picked fruits and food from restaurants’ and stores’ dumpsters and took all the good products out and showed how much it was at local parks. It completely amazed and confused me knowing that all the food that was being thrown out could’ve fed two of America’s populations, but still about 50 million people in America are suffering without food. It was a great idea for him to make a system where no one would have to dumpster dive, but instead the restaurants and store should save the food and set it aside for them before they throw it out. It reminds me of this ad I get regularly, where the site sells irregular and deformed fruits and vegetables, because grocery stores immediately throw them away when looking at them. What a shame it is to know that there are workers putting hours and hours in harvesting and planting these fruits and a whole bunch of them just go straight into the trash. I guess it’s an improvement to know that there are systems being set up to not throw these foods away; but still a lot of improvement needed because there are so many more people that can benefit from these foods that don’t have any resources or money.

I think it is so true that our preoccupation with stuff makes us unhappy. For too many of us, we struggle for the necessities, but some people who are able to attain the necessities still struggle for more. Our preoccupation with more, more, more leaves us constantly unsatisfied. After a certain point, money really can't buy happiness. I think it is really great that people like Peter, who are financially able to make these decisions, do so.  It is important that people with that privilege are seen making these kinds of decisions; it becomes something to aspire to, another image of success that is not just rampant consumption. It is part of a much bigger cultural change, but a very important part. Once more people are convinced that success is not simply buying everything we can get our hands on, our culture of consumerism can be tempered.




</p><hr>

<p>

This is one takeaway I did not have from this film. I am so glad you brought up these points. It is so important to have perspective, to keep class and other factors in mind even when talking about climate change. If I think about it now, most of the films and texts we’ve read feature middle-class or upper-class people, able to make adjustments if they want to because they have the funds and luxury of choice. So, you are right that is not fair for people with that luxury to assume everyone has it and everyone can reduce their lifestyles. I enjoyed the film but I’m glad you gave me this perspective. We need serious systematic change to beat this issue. Individuals can make certain lifestyle changes, but it’s still going to come down to government regulation and political action. 
   <br><Br>

I did enjoy the film. I liked Peter’s theme of the head, the hands, and the heart. It really makes a climate conscious lifestyle more appealing. The switch to that environmentally friendly life is one not only good for our planet, but for our own happiness and well-being. Peter and his family make that sort of lifestyle look so good. The simplicity of it seems so intriguing in a lot of ways. He meditates, bikes, lives as a freegan. He talks about how people are happier while doing environmentally friendly things and I believe it. By simplifying your life, focusing less on the stuff our society is so addicted to, it can be so rewarding, especially if your simplified lifestyle works in support of the environment.



</p><hr>

<p>
I think Being The Change brought up many of the issues we have already discussed, but with a different approach, and in a way that made it seem much easier to make changes in our lifestyles. Peter really emphasizes the importance of making small individual changes, and getting involved in one's community in order to encourage others to take actions similar to yours. 
   <br><Br>
One of the things that Peter states is that "there's this desire that we have in our society to just solve all of our problems with technology" and I couldn't agree more. It’s interesting that a scientist at NASA would say this but it’s also indicative of how bad our reliance on technology must be if a scientist at NASA has to say it. I think consumerism and our love of technology go hand in hand. We buy anything that makes life easier, even if it only increases efficiency by a small percentage. Many of the ideas brought up in this film reminded me of the convenience of minimalism. You could also tell that everyone in the film was genuinely happy and not just faking it for the camera, so it really shows that the choices you make in favor of the planet will always be choices that favor you.
   <br><Br>
Also, I liked that Peter touched upon dumpster diving in his film. It reminded me of an essay I read in high school called “On Dumpster Diving” by Lars Eighner, who talks about his experience as a homeless man looking to satisfy his hunger. It was such an interesting read that it actually made me want to go around looking into restaurant dumpsters. The author talks about the large variety of food one can find, and how to tell if it’s still good or not. He also talks about how restaurants throw out food because of small issues like pizza that was ordered by a prank caller, or food refused because it was cold. Moreover he mentions that universities are great places to scavenge for food because students throw out perfectly good food simply because they don’t know how to tell if it’s still safe to eat, or because they are off to break. In my experience as well, students tend to be some of the most wasteful people, especially based on what I see at the dining commons. Everyday I see people take more food than they can eat and then put it on the racks to be thrown away. To start dealing with these issues, I think places that sell food need to give away leftovers to the homeless, or at least sell food that is about to go bad at low prices. Personally, I think we need to become conscious about how much we eat and then fill our plates accordingly, and we should look at expiry dates when buying food in order to make sure it doesn’t get wasted, as well as learn how to tell whether some food is indeed expired or still has a few more days left.

In the film “Being the Change” the question of “what can we do, and what is enough?” in regards to mitigating the climate crisis is explored. However, this documentary takes a different approach to the problem at hand. I liked this week’s film because I found the solutions and the advice given to be more specific and personalized. Although I knew that personal actions play a role in mitigating the problem, this documentary made a more convincing argument on the importance and impact that it has. By documenting a family that is able to live happy and sustainable lives, I thought it was interesting to see how simple it can be to significantly cut your carbon footprint ten-fold.  For example, the biggest way to reduce your carbon footprint is by giving up flying. This remains consistent with what we learned in the past with flying being the worst thing you can do for the environment. 
   <br><Br>
The mentality behind your personal actions is also important. I liked how in the film, he mentioned how the problem of climate change is so persistent because people will have the mentality that "my actions won’t have much of a difference if there are billions of other people who are still going to keep doing it". Although this is true, imagine if everyone was to think this way–mitigating the climate crisis would be impossible! Another point that I thought was very important was changing the way we eat and think about food. It was very sad and frustrating to learn about just how much perfectly good food is being wasted when there are 50 million Americans that experience food insecurity. This to me is an issue that needs to be solved. As a college student who struggles with food insecurity, it makes me wonder how we have gotten to a point as a society where we allow this to happen to the people and the environment.

The idea from the film that you mentioned also resonated a lot with me: “my actions won’t have much of a difference if there are billions of other people who are still going to keep doing it.” I was guilty of having this mentality in the beginning of the class. I couldn’t see why I should give up beef or flying or anything else considering nobody else would. Every day I saw people living their daily lives, unbothered by the fact that so many of their actions contribute just a little bit more to the climate crisis. My own family has more cars than we need, fly more often than we need to, and eat more meat than is absolutely necessary. Being surrounded by people who continue their bad habits, it was hard for me to convince myself to break my own. The difference between me and a majority of these other people, though, is how educated I am on the topic of the climate crisis compared to them. It’s really hard for me to continue doing things I know hurt the planet now that I know just how much damage I’m causing. I know that there’s definitely some people that also know the drastic impacts of their bad habits, but don’t care enough to change them. Most people, though, are really not aware of the severity of their actions (I had no idea how much flying ruined the environment, for example). Those of us who do know how crucial it is for humans to change their ways need to do a better job of sharing the information we have. This is why I appreciate people like Ken!





</span></div><hr>
<p>

I really like the quote from the documentary “Tomorrow” that Ken mentioned. “Today, we need a new direction, a new objective, a new dream.” Yes. The old dream of human being might be prosperity, which is represented by living in a large house and owning a car or even more than one car or eating luxurious food. However, this is not the case for now. As showed in the film, Peter’s way of sustainable life is the dream that we should pursue now. He is a middle-class, so he should be able to afford larger houses. However, he chooses the “green” way. This is very recommendable for people who are wealthy and are capable of consume a lot. Leading a sustainable life is provides a kind of spiritual satisfaction instead of physical. Those who find themselves difficult to feel satisfied from consuming and always wants to consume more should try to obtain spiritual satisfaction instead. Moreover, students and children should be taught to not admire luxury lives and learn to use their money more efficiently and reduce their carbon footprint as much as possible.

I agree that we need a new view of "prosperity" in the American culture and society. Peter was inspiring to watch because of the fact that he was an average, middle class American. He could easily be someone I know here in California yet he consumes 1/10 what an average American would. That is crazy and inspiring. Not only does his lifestyle change come with positive consequences for the planet, but it obviously had a positive impact on his family, mental health, and overall well being. The truth is that sustainable lifestyles are much more fulfilling than consumer led ones. So then the question arises, why do we care so much about material prosperity?

I watched the Being the Change film and I found it incredible how the climate scientist, Peter Kalmus was able to reduce his climate footprint to a tenth of the average US citizen. That is absolutely astonishing. Though, it would make sense due to the fact that he is an expert in this field and knows exactly the best ways of going about it. 
   <br><Br>


Imagine if his whole community was living the same as he was! Using vegetable oil as fuel for their cars, reducing the amount of stuff they have, meditating, reducing their food waste and composting and so much more. This is a trend that we all need to get on because it would prove beneficial to our planet. Though, it is important to note that not everyone is able to do this considering economic backgrounds and the conditions one lives in. This is a solution that those that are well off and those that have the highest carbon footprints should switch to because not everyone is contributing to the crisis as much as these people. 
   <br><Br>


I want to one day live like this not only because it would be great for the planet, but it would make my life feel more meaningful. It allows my life to be more filling because I am living in a way that is giving back to my planet and I can feel more connected to my community. My life would also become more simpler due to the idea that I would be making everything on my own and seeking my neighbors to help versus just going out to buy it. I would probably learn a lot more skills and build deeper relationships with my friends and family. A life like this would be wonderful.

I agree with your comment. Peter really did a great jobs showing how daily change can reduce the carbon emissions. It’s really shocking that he reduced his carbon emission from 20 tons to 2 tons. We could learn from him. If he can do it, many of us can make it. Once everyone makes the same goal as he did, world will have a huge change. But just like you said in comments, based on different social and economic background, not everyone fit the same method as Peter introduced. But the one better off on the materialistic life who contributed to the most amount of carbon emission should use it.

<p>
My first impression of this film is that it is different from the other films that we have watched because it focuses more on how an individual can change their actions to reduce CO2 emissions rather than showing the impacts of climate change on the environment. Peter Kalamus is a perfect figure for all of us to follow because he (just like most of the population) didn’t care about his emissions however, after feeling anxious about his actions he decided to make a change. Kalamus’ main approach to changing daily habits to reduce emissions comes from three things- the head, hands, and heart. First, the head is having the ability to recognize the problems arising with climate change and understanding that it will be a drastic change to live a low emission or even emission free lifestyle. Next, the hands are the physical representation of exerting an environmentally friendly and conscious lifestyle. For example, this would be gardening, riding a bike, or not flying. Lastly, the heart is the emotional reaction one has towards the reason for changing their lifestyle in favor of preserving the environment. For people like Kalamus, doing the things he does eliminates his anxiety and makes him feel happy about his actions and the people he surrounds himself with. After watching this film, it was the first time that I understood how to make changes in my life to reduce my emissions and not only that, but I can see how it would foster a chain reaction of positivity in my life. After learning about climate change in this class, it is inspiring to see first hand accounts of people who integrate environmental consciousness into their lifestyles. I would recommend this film to any of my friends and family any day.

<p>
Peter Kalmus in "Being the Change" stated in the film, "We have a desire to solve all problems with technology," and followed with "there are some situations where technology isn't the best option. People often think that technology will solve all of our problems, however we have a person with a PhD in physics telling us otherwise. In the film, Kalmus makes the audience reevaluate their ideas of technology and science solving the climate crisis. Many of the actions that Kalmus takes in reducing his carbon footprint does not require technology. I feel it’s important to evaluate the association of technology and process, as technology is created by humans and can be created as they please. For example, we see technology that destroys the environment, such as fracking pumps. Technology can make things easier, but some of those things that are made easier could be easing the extraction and exploitation of resources
   <br><Br>

One thing that I questioned in the film is its disconnect with politics and social relations. Kalmus states that global warming is a result of people wanting more. He individualizes the climate crisis at some points and sees it as the individual’s job to do their own part. Though he states that we all collectively have to change our lifestyle to mitigate the climate crisis, we can have a large community lowering their carbon footprint, however policy that allows for the degradation of the world would still happen. Perhaps the film did not have time to look over, but I find it important that we don’t forget the corporations that are largely affecting the environment, especially affecting the lives and communities of poor people. It is ideal that people as individuals and collective communities work together, however, this may be difficult with lack of resources; the government does not particularly provide any. Pasadena is a wealthy city, and though one may have the resources to change their lifestyles there, the reality of it is that there are several people who may not be able to do so since they do not have resources and policies do not favor an environmentally friendly lifestyle. For example, Pasadena has many engineers who help fix devices for the community on their free time, and many other communities may not. Though local communities working together does help lower the carbon footprint, it is important to remember who the real perpetrator of climate change is. It is not the average American, but rather corporations who exploit the land and people as well as politicians and those in power who enable and allow this to happen.

I watched the film Tomorrow, and I can easily say that this film is my favorite of those we've watched for this course. Instead of feeling scared or hopeless, like when watching other documentaries on these topics, solutions were presented, and they actually have great outcomes. This film shows how simple changes can actually be inspiring to the community, strengthening their bond to their inhabited spaces. The creators approached climate change on every level, including farming, sustainable energy, recycling, living arrangements, and education.
   <br><Br>
Instead of focusing on the destroyed areas of the world, like the other films, this one highlighted places that are proactive, mostly in Europe. It was fascinating to see the abundant farms and the techniques that they use to harvest as many crops in small areas. I don't remember the term that was used, but they save energy by letting the plants' work together to protect and nourish one another due to their characteristics and needs. For example, basil can grow in the shade, so it is planted next to the tomatoes. The potent smell of basil also keeps bugs away, reducing their threat on the tomatoes. Another change that excited me were the sidewalks and bike lanes being stretched to encourage people to use them. This creates an overall healthier place because of a good air quality not tainted by the carbon emissions we've become accustomed to, as well as active citizens who contribute to a healthier planet daily. I think America has much to learn from these European countries.
   <br><Br>
Lastly, the education system in Finland surprised me. The students' education are taken very seriously considering the ratio of teachers to students. They train the future generations to be quick problem solvers, practice communication, and stress the importance of confidence in each individual. The alterations that the system has made will create an everlasting proactive community.

I feel the same way as the given film, Living The Change, is quite interesting in the fact that it adds even more possibilities we can take in taking the right step in the way of a much more greener and cleaner planet away from the tainted fossil fuel culture. One of the greater problems they look at on the industrial farm situation is that there is a lack of biodiversity since major industrial farms focus one large crop for profit. This is an issue because of the fact that the one single crop is against the natural ways of the world where an environment needs biodiversity to create it's defense against the harms of the world, yet we implement that through the use of pesticides and manures. It is eye opening to me how much biodiversity is important in the environmental aspect in both the benefits of farming and for the planet health and defense. Alongside that, what also was such an eye opener is how much interest is such a terrible aspect on our international economy as without it, we could be more beneficial working less hours, but we the people pay for the interest of the bigger companies all across the world which is a massive issue. Yet, with all this in conjunction, the importance of community in the green movement against global warming is beyond the larger levels of fighting against the major industries as it starts with us. As we see in New Zealand, community farming is beneficial on helping the environment through creating a bio diverse farm and farm that doesn't require the need for fossil fuels and other harms such as pesticides. Creating community farms can be beneficial around the world were we have seen them in Detroit as well as we have seen in the film Tomorrow, it can bring the community together under the same idea of a better planet, reduce the needs to transport produce across the nation which resulted in widespread burning of fossil fuels, and because these farms will be small in comparison to industrial farms, they wont need the use of fossil fuels to maintain the crops. The industrial farm and international economy have become such issues for humanity and it's relationship with the planet, to the point that many other alternatives such as solar panels and wind turbines cant just completely overhaul what our society has grown reliant on. That is where having a small changes, like those living the change in the change in New Zealand, can help us as a planet take greater strides in changing our own lifestyles for the better of the planet to the point where we can reduce much of our fossil fuel consumption and turn down the damaging pesticides of our planet.
   <br><Br>
Overall, this film is one of my favorite ones since it opens my eyes to how we can live in the change when we grow up. Being in the works to become a bio major, it is interesting to see bio concepts like biodiversity and various others play roles in being beneficial for the planet and for ways to defeat the ensuing climate change. Other than that, the interactive visuals in conjunction with the variety of people they interviewed to create a well rounded explanation for living in the change, it was really influential and educational for me and stood out as one my favorite films thus far as it took many aspects I enjoyed from the other films we viewed this year whilst still being able to teach me something I have never even thought of, like the issues of interest and the importance of biodiversity over mass single cropped farms.

I totally agree!!! Tomorrow makes me feel as though there is possibility and hope and happiness in store for the future: a world where climate change is a reality could be a world where people are more wealthy from personal farms, more happy from close connection, and more healthy from alternative transportation and community involvement. There is definitely a sense that climate change is a bad thing, but at the same time all over the world people have begun to make radical changes to their lives to try and reduce the impact of a globalized food system.
    <br><Br>
Another thing that I found so interesting about the film was the way in which it presented the modern, globalized food industry as something that was stupid: where people literally destroyed their land and their water in order to rase enough cattle that they would never eat from, but rather ship half way around the world to a place that will only eat half of it. When the food system is presented in this light, then the alternative of mixed and local farming seems very very interesting, particularly with regards to the fact that it can be such a profitable side-hustle. If everyone in Detroit were making local gardens again, then not only could the city be fed on a massive scale, but the people growing food could make money in a way that puts more emphasis on local business and food production. This gets back to the central reason why I liked your comment so much: this movie makes me feel inspired. It makes me realize that the problem of climate change might just force us to make our communities a better place.




<br><hr>
I too absolutely adore this film. It's so eye-opening to what major impact people from around the world can have and how much effort goes into being such amazing people. You're so right that America has lots to learn. Our approach to climate change is minimal at best and our education is trash compared to other nations. As Ken has said, education is vital in solving climate change, and having an environment where children learn with such compassion and aid is something I think we could all use. I'm honestly awed by the creativity and ingenuity put into these efforts by those displayed in the film and it's really something I hope to live up to one day.

After "Being the Change", a couple things stuck out to me. First was the head, peace sign, and heart. It stood for head, hands, and heart. Head, understanding and seizing the opportunities to make connections. Hands, doing something physically for the environment. Heart, becoming passionate and loving life for the healthy lifestyle change.
   <br><Br>
Second, was “People who do these environmentally friendly things are actually happier. They’ve got more meaning in their life.” I can see how the two correlate because of the healthier and more natural lifestyle. The film discusses the power of Vipassana meditation and retreats. Specifically Therese Brummell, I found interesting because I feel we can relate to her. We’re unsure or hesitant about being the change but when we agree to it, it’s life changing. 
   <br><Br>
The lifestyle these people chose to adapt to seems happier and healthier for them. He even tattooed the meditation pillars on himself. “Samma Sati”, or correct awareness, and “Upekkha”, or equanimity. Changing to such lifestyle not only helps your health and the world, but also the well being of your mind. Becoming a person more mindful and not bent out of shape when something bad happens is something to look forward to. 
   <br><Br>
It's clearly shown in the film how excited and at peace the individuals are. While driving Maeby, the guy said "I still get excited when changing gears." The passion keeps growing.
   <br><Br>
I think there is potential of being a movement, but we're still missing something. #BeTheChange

I have really mixed feelings about this film, so I want to split my comment into two parts; I want to first address the effectiveness, then secondly I’ll address the message.
    <br><Br>
The effectiveness, to me, was not very good at all. The first thirty minutes of the documentary felt all over the place. I was twenty minutes in and had no idea where we were going. I honestly felt like I was watching a high school iMovie student project. Peter Kalmus has an incredible story and he was providing some good content in his interviews, but the film was so poorly structured it was difficult to stay engaged. There were parts that felt unnecessary. This film probably could’ve been about fifteen minutes shorter and would’ve been more effective.
    <br><Br>
The message, on the other hand, I thought was beautiful. The change will not come unless someone is the change. If you want to see a change in the world, be the person to take that first step and make the change. Peter Kalmus is a great example of someone who sees something wrong with the world (reckless greenhouse gas emissions) and sets out to do something about it. By practicing what he preaches, Kalmus is a more believable activist for the climate whom people respect and trust. By being a leading example, and bringing others along with him, his actions can lead to a culture shift where more people will be conscious of their own emissions and create a more sustainable world.

I couldn’t have said it better myself. If the documentary was more concise and perhaps more intentional with the storytelling method, the visuals and structure would complement Peter Kalmus’s message much more effectively. Although I don’t think this was nearly the best film we’ve gotten to watch in this class, there were still key points and takeaways that really resonated with me. 

    <br><Br>

I remember hearing Ghandi’s quote about being the change we wish to see in the world in seventh grade at a leadership conference. Ever since then, it’s come back to mind in all aspects of my life. In terms of the climate crisis, it’s absolutely necessary that we live out the ideals that we continually make comments about each week. We need to follow Kalmus’s example of leading a movement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. What really stood out to me was the fact that he was able to reduce his own emissions to 10% of the average American’s and still live a relatively normal life. I noticed that a lot of the measures he took helped the environment in more than one way. For example, converting his car so that it would be able to run on cooking oil instead of gasoline not only prevents the burning of fossil fuels, but also reduces waste from his kitchen. It’s easy to be skeptical about the feasibility of these measures, but we must be the leaders in believing in our cause. That way, others will follow our actions, and we will create a collective effort in combating climate change.

(Tomorrow)
    <br><Br>
Among all the films I have watched, this two-hour documentary, Tomorrow, gives me the deepest impression and makes me think a lot in different aspects. However, had not I watched previous films about climate, I would not have understood this film's connotation and meaning properly.
     <br><Br>

Focused on actions taken by people and companies in different parts of the world, this film undoubtfully succeeded in communicating its subject by smooth logic and perfect editing and typography techniques. First, I want to talk about the nice structure of this film. This documentary contains five main themes: Agriculture, Energy, Economy, Democracy, and Education. More than just simply put five topics together to get a combination, the filmmaker implicitly sets a specific order in which each chapter in this film relates to the next one. To allow a natural transition between the two chapters, the author adds some scenes that are relevant to this topic, accompanied by different styles of music to convey the author's mood at this time. It allows me to think deeply by taking a look at the circumstance surrounding us.
     <br><Br>

Now let’s back to the content of this film. I was inspired significantly when knowing that people all over the world are doing things they can, no matter trivial or significant, to improve their lives and change the world. In the agriculture area, for example, people in Detroit are trying (actually they have made it) to become self-efficient. Not to “save the world”, but “create a better living condition for the offspring”, people plant almost everywhere in the city to feed themselves. In this way, they reduce transportation and greenhouse gas emissions, and without the use of chemical pesticides they protect the soil and rivers. Before watching this film, I did not know that 70-75% of our food is from individual farmers instead of industrial farmers and the former one is far more efficient and earth-friendly. 
    <br><Br>
According to this, it seems to be more reasonable to support individual farmers or plant by ourselves.
     <br><Br>

From the scale of individual to state, in San Francisco, laws have been made to encourage citizens and businesses to participate in recycling. With <waste composting program>, for example, fertilizing 1/4 of farmland with compost allows the soil to absorb 3/4 of CO2 emissions. I believe in a famous saying: "There is no real garbage in the world, only the resources that were misplaced".
     <br><Br>

What makes this film extraordinary is that it not only contains advice on our daily lives but also points out problems and offers solutions at the political and economic levels, as well as innovations education. Among the measures mentioned in the film, what impressed me most was the democratic participation in government in Kuthambakkam India. Along with election, there is another way of representing the population: drawing lots. Villages obey the laws and plans made by themselves actively. Although they do not have enough expertise, they gain more freedom. At any time, people should obey the higher law: protection of the earth and human rights.
     <br><Br>

All in all, I see hope in this film. It is confirmed that people have the willingness and passion to make a change and I'm sure more and more people will join in. As a student, I will do everything I can, like recycling the trash and taking bicycles, to help to save the world.

(Tomorrow)I was also very impressed by this documentary and while it does not center directly only on the climate crisis, I can see how every topic covered in the film: economy, education, democracy, and agriculture all have a significant impact on the climate crisis. One comment during the film I found important is “how could we not afford to,” that is to afford to go green. As Ken has reiterated throughout most of the course, most of these sustainable and green policies and systems are in the end, much more affordable than the cost it would be to maintain our dependency on fossil fuels. As the film shows, by investing in small farms, a much wider population could be fed as opposed to massive corporate farms that only feed a small percent of the population and are so costly to maintain. By investing in bike infrastructure like in Copenhagen, thousands of dollars and lives are saved when people stop riding cars. Copenhagen’s treatment of inmates- not punishing them but rehabilitating them and providing them with lessons on eco-skills that will allow them to have high paying jobs that are also ecofriendly when they are released is something to be modeled after. Having local currency such as the Bristol Pound, helps circulate money more locally and funds diverse independent small businesses, rather than allowing the 97% of money in the UK to be controlled by private banks. By putting more money into education and reforming the system as a whole as done in Finland, more students are educated and have overall higher achievement compared to other school systems around the world. By giving free education at all levels-elementary to university-young minds are empowered to do what they can to fight the climate crisis. As you said, all of these achievements shows that no action is too small and if we implemented these systems globally, we can look forward to an overall better tomorrow.

Being the Change was inspiring to watch because it focused on a more optimistic approach to fighting the climate crisis. The way Peter and his family lived was sustainable and it led to them leading happier and more fulfilling lives. It was also interesting to see the variety of possible changes that could be implemented in a suburban community, such as Humanure and the Repair Cafe. The Repair Cafe especially is such a unique and effective way to get a community to not waste as much by simple acts of kindness, such as mending torns clothes or fixing broken toasters.
     <br><Br>
One of the scenes I liked the most in this film was how he took perfectly intact food from dumpsters and created public displays out of the to raise awareness for how much of our food is going to waste just at grocery stores alone. This is an issue that not a lot of Americans are aware of or willing to take action for, so the more people that are aware and educated on how wasteful we are a society, the more people will hopefully try to change their habits. Dumping out edible food just because of aesthetic imperfections is especially despicable when taking into account how many people in this country are food insecure, and in desperate need of their next meal. Grocery stores should be mandated to donate the food they were going to toss out to food banks or homeless shelters. Or, we should follow in the footsteps of France and instead sell these slightly damaged (but still edible) goods at discount grocery stores, so they are more affordable for those who need it.

Growing up listening to the same spew about climate change, it sometimes normalizes the topic and makes the issue seem less important than it really is. However, similar to Kalmus from “Being The Change,” many of us do worry about future generations where our own children might live one day. This seems to be a route many people take to highlight the importance of slowing climate change. Even if Climate change is an important issue to us, it is sometimes hard to implement these ideas into our life and actually do what Kalmus was able to do. In order to actually make a difference, we have to stick to the “Head-Hand-Heart” idea. You have to have an intrinsic motivation to do these things, actually apply the changes, and put  all you can into it. Watching the documentary, I was surprised to see how joyful all of the people being interviewed actually were as they talked about how their life has changed after discovering things like meditation. People were actually happy to take part of movements like the repair café in New Zealand. It seemed that not only were these individuals making a difference in the environment, but they were also more grounded on a physical and even spiritual level. It is easy to lose touch of your own identity and feelings when you’re not living life for the right reasons or not genuinely joyful. The documentary also brought up that individual change leads to collective change. This was really important for me to hear as I’ve been trying to implement some of these ideas into my life but was met with questions like: “How are you making a difference if you’re only one person?” This individual  mindset will keep us in the same predicament. We have to stop thinking of ourselves as a powerless individuals, and start thinking as a powerful collective or there will never be a revolution for change.

This movie is like a realization of what our lives will look like in the future. Each person in the community lives self-sufficiently (somewhat)—recycling waste cooking oil for fuel, planting food in their own gardens, composting human waste, etc. Each person also supports each other with various services: repairing, waste oil supply, etc.
      <br><Br>
  However we can still see how the narrator struggles to live without a car in LA. The problem with the city design has shown up once again, and it goes to show how political action is still very much important because the infrastructure and the layout of the cities are not going to change with a change at a local level. Nonetheless this sets an excellent example for us on how much we can change as a community, and how lives can be good even without being fixated on acquiring money. 
     <br><Br>

   I do want to say something about the odd beginning of the movie. The extensive description on meditation threw me off when I started watching. I was even wondering at some point if this movie is just advocating Buddhism with little mentioning of how this will help mitigate climate crisis. Referring back to Bending The Curve, this movie goes from background to result, which is not optimal for a documentary. I can see people stop watching it at the beginning because of it (or maybe it is just me).

I think that one of the most important points that Ken makes in this video is that the current consumer-based "American Dream" can change to support families comfortably without having to produce as many greenhouse gases. Ken highlights that some people believe climate change activism will require them to live in a small apartment with only candles for lights. However, people fail to realize that such extreme measures are not required. Kalmus' accomplishments to reduce his carbon footprint to 1/10 of the average American highlights that an efficient suburban lifestyle is indeed possible for a small group of people. I think Kalmus' work demonstrates that living this sustainably is possible for every single American. Kalmus has a lot of credibility (in my opinion) because he is originally from Pasadena, a very affluent city (therefore resulting in a lot of industrialization and released greenhouse gases) and still managed to dramatically reduce the harm he is inflicting on the environment.

     <br><Br>

Overall, like many other comments mention, I believe the film highlights the difference between individual and collective efforts. Kalmus and his family are a great example of an individual effort to become more eco-friendly. Moreover, he created a documentary and book in order to convince others to also reduce their carbon footprint. Collective efforts can be seen with non-profit environmental organizations such as Sierra Club. With a community of people, it becomes easier to be dedicated to one cause which in turn unites everyone involved in it. I believe both forms of environmental awareness have their benefits in convincing others to reduce their carbon footprint. Individual efforts are great because when showcased to others it can motivate them to imitate eco-friendly lifestyles displayed through media such as news reports or documentaries. Collective efforts are great, however, at bringing general awareness to the public. In addition, with a community comes a lot of manpower which can be utilized to clean up trash scattered around nature. Overall, I believe both forms are necessary to bring more awareness to the climate crisis and convince the general public that living sustainably can still lead to happy lifestyles.

I enjoyed this film because it showed how life can look when you emit very little carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This was great to see because these two people lived very normal lives. They might have lived simple lives but why does life need to be any more complex than that? I found it so cool how they converted their car to run on wasted vegetable oil. Not everyone can afford a tesla but you can afford to make small changes like this in life and these changes add up. 
     <br><Br>


A large take away that I had from this documentary was centered around the idea of individual change. There was a short part of the documentary that discussed the idea of each individual making changes to daily life and why this is important. I think a lot of people develop this mindset where they question the effectiveness of making individual changes since one person can only help so much. However, it is this mindset that is restricting changes from being made. People think “why would I stop driving cars and eating meat if my contribution alone isn't going to help out in the grand scheme of things?” And the unfortunate part is that this is actually very true. Each person making small changes alone won't really help much. However, if people start to make these changes others around them will be inspired to join the cause. One person might not make a difference but the combination of hundreds will. This is clearly shown with the idea of plane use in the documentary. If one person chooses not to fly then nothing changes. That is the plane that they would have ridden on still goes up into the air. But if 300 people decide not to fly then the plane never takes off and the release of greenhouse gasses are reduced. We have to learn to not be afraid to make these sacrifices. 
     <br><Br>

The only part of this film that I found contradictory to what we have been discussing in class was the explanation that moving to cities breaks the natural cycle of life. This part of the documentary talked about how it is harmful to move into cities, yet in class we have been talking about how beneficial it is to move into a city. I guess this can be controversial and I would enjoy learning more about the pros and cons of both living options.

Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution was an interesting look at one person's journey to making lifestyle changes that most would think of as extreme in an effort to selflessly reduce their environmental impact. One of the messages that Peter communicates with this documentary is that if you are going to advocate for change, living and being that change is a crucial tool in getting people to listen to you. I really liked how he made it a point to highlight that almost all of the lifestyle changes weren't ones that increased his cost of living - a lot of the times he is actually able to reduce his living costs. This is something that is extremely important when trying to get people to live more sustainably as cost and inconvenience are two of the main barriers that prevent people from even listening. 
     <br><Br>
Peter definitely was not afraid to share some more radical ideas. While humanure and vegetable oil fueled cars aren't going to be options that many people take, his selflessness and devotion to living with as low impact as possible is inspiring. I don't know if I would recommend this film to someone that isn't already interested in environmental issues as I think the lifestyle he lives can be seen as taboo, but I believe in his message and commitment. The hopefulness is a refreshing reminder that while our interactions with the environment must change, the change can be done - and it'll likely make us all happier and more content in the process.

I completely agree with you that Peter Kalmus's advocations to reduce one's environmental footprint can be kind of extreme. You bring up a crucial point that cost and inconvenience are two barriers that prevent people from listening, let alone taking action. Although it is admirable that his family is able to live with 1/10 the carbon footprint of the average American family, this is something that is either simply not possible for many Americans (many families belong to the working class and have to do all they can to get by -- going back to your notion that cost is a significant barrier) or extremely undesirable for others (again, due to the barrier of inconvenience). However, I will say seeing Peter's family in the film was very inspiring because of the way they were able to live a simple lifestyle and were content with everything they had. This notion of true happiness is what really needs to be explored when discussing climate change and how we can deal with it. I believe that the first step in the right direction for anyone who wants to make a difference, is to be able to understand true happiness and building social capital.

Tomorrow was an extremely interesting documentary that sheds light on all the possibilities the world can do in order to save our planet. One quote that really stuck out to me was when they were discussing cutting down on emissions, “when we think of cutting down our emissions by 8, 9, 10% a year as having less when in reality it could be fantastic.” I think as a society we are so worried about the unknown and the combination of the unknown and the idea of cutting back makes us assume we are losing when in reality it could be one of the best things to happen to our planet. I really enjoyed the set up of the documentary as it split up topics into sections such as agriculture, energy, economy, and education. In terms of agriculture, it was surprising to hear that local farms could have more productivity than industrial ones. There are so many innovative tools and farming techniques that people have come up with that prove that you don’t need machines and chemicals to make the best thing. This documentary illustrates that you don’t need big, industrial companies to create productivity and efficiency. In terms of energy, it was super inspiring to see that 67% of the people in Copenhagen do not drive cars, and have healthier people because people chose to bike and walk to most places. It was also extremely impressive to see that San Francisco is trying to reach 0 waste, by law forcing people to split up their trash from compost, recyclables, and other waste. Also, to hear that if every city in the US recycled 75% of its waste, 1.5 million new jobs would be created shows that we could boost our economy through being green. Although all of these changes are uplifting and inspiring to see I wish more of changes would occur in the US since we should be helping lead to save our planet not hurting it.

I thought this film was really interesting and inspiring to watch. It was cool to see all these people living very simple and environmentally friendly lives while spreading joy, love and a sense of community to the people in their lives. I liked what Kalmus said about how we, as humans, need to stop thinking that human intelligence means we can do whatever we want and destroy our environment and that we are not above the basic law of the biosphere. I agree with what the people in the film were saying about feeling happier and more satisfied when you do environmentally friendly and sustainable things. It doesn’t make me feel good when I use a plastic bag or buy food that comes in excessive packaging. I feel a lot happier and healthier when I do things with the planet in mind. There is always something each of us can improve at and we can all improve our carbon footprint in one way or another.
      <br><Br>
It was so interesting to see that the family has a car that runs on vegetable oil from restaurants. While this is a lot more work and harder to maintain then just using a regular gas car, it is much better for the environment. We are all going to have  to make  changes to  our  lifestyles, and while they may not all be things we want to have to do or things that take extra time, it is worth the sacrifice if it means saving our planet from absolute destruction. 
      <br><Br>
It is insane to me that we produce enough food to feed the entire American population  twice, yet 50 million Americans are food insecure. Obviously, we are doing something very wrong and inefficient with our food system. The food system is just one example of how the whole structure of many aspects of society have to be completely transformed and  reconstructed. 
      <br><Br>
It  was very cool to see the Kalmus family so happy and content with what they were  doing and how they were living their lives. Personally, that kind of joy and togetherness is a lot more valuable than any amount of money or objects.

I was also touched by the sentence that “we, as humans, need to stop thinking that human intelligence means we can do whatever we want and destroy our environment.” Although industries and technology improvements can make people’s lives easier and more convenient, it will harm the environment and the Earth which we lived, such as flights, fossil-fuel vehicles and so on. In the aspect of protecting the environment, individual changes and cultural changes are closely linked. Like Kalmus in the film mentions, if there is only one person doesn’t take air flights, the global carbon emissions may not be changed. However, if his sustainable lifestyle is imitated by others, and his environment-friendly opinion is widely spread, more people will refuse to travel in air, thus making a huge difference in carbon emissions.
         <br><Br>
    In the film, Kalmus and his family have lifestyles that can be called “sustainable.” He said the reason why he only had two children is that two is just below the replacement rate, and having more will affect the population growth negatively. Also, he usually put some vegetable oil from the restaurant into his car as the fuel. By doing these, he successfully limited his carbon footprint to 10 percent as the average American, and at the same time, he still lived happily with his family. Nowadays, people’s pleasure often connected with consuming, and the more they consume, the server environments are damaged. Just like Ken mentioned in his lecture, by employing this film, Kalmus effectively shows his audience that “living without fossil fuel is not only possible, it can be better.”

I think Tomorrow provides a kind of breath of fresh air when it comes to this topic by making the majority of the documentary cover feel good stories of communities coming up with solutions to climate change, oligarchy, and education. I wasn't left with any feelings of hopelessness. After being shown instance after instance of people who are doing their part to change the future, I definitely feel more eager to contribute in some way. What surprised me about the film was that it opened up as if the entire film would be about climate change, but it ended up covering such a wide variety of topics. Sometimes when I take in large chunks of information about many movements at once, I feel overwhelmed because I want to contribute to all of these different sectors, but don't know which I want to concentrate the majority of my energy on.
      <br><Br>
What never fails to shock me is how much further ahead Europe, and specifically northern European countries are in addressing these urgent issues than the majority of the United States. U.S. culture has gone down such a vastly more extreme route than everywhere else due to the privileges that come with living here. Our government encourages this toxic culture too, ignoring the issues that require action over big business interests. American politics concern me because the party system allows future representatives to strip away any and all beneficial progress made by previous representatives. I'd like to learn more about economics so that I can better understand how localized currencies function. I don't know much about money, but I know that with every solution provided to a problem, money is an entirely new problem to be addressed in itself. I'd also like to learn about food culture at UCSB; how we as a school approach urban farming, food distribution, and food waste.

I have watched this film at least twice by now, and every time I watch this film again, I noticed some new important points related to the materials taught in English 22 and English 23. Before this quarter, the study of English 23, I didn’t notice or even hear anyone saying that food waste has a significant impact on climate crisis and justice. Now, when I heard Peter said that 40% of the produced food is wasted and, the data immediately jumped to my mind and remind me of how much methane that will be released into the atmosphere. Furthermore, when Peter mentioned that his car, Maeby (this name is so interesting and cute), uses grease oil. It reminds me that the waste or the part that we don’t want in the kitchen or supermarkets is being used to producing other things. For example, in the film “the Wasted!”, there is a factory that uses the bread edges to produce beer and feed the animals, which reduces the influence of wasted food on the earth. Grease oil could solve the problems and energy crisis and carbon footprints.

I just noticed that nothing you did for solving climate change will only solve one specific issue. It will probably solve a series of problems (even not only about climate change but also social justice). This is like a chain effect. Thus, while being asked, “Are the things you do really enough to make our world a better place?” I think the answer is Yes as long as there are a number of people doing that. Maybe the things we do are not enough to change the world, but surely the things we do will impact many aspects of our society, which makes it a better place.

I agree that food waste is an underrepresented issue for how damaging it is environmentally.. not to mention how many people in the world are starving. In connection to this week's reading, the conversation about being "freegan" opens up a conversation about the largely unknown issue of food waste. This "chain effect" you're talking about is also represented well in the other film, Tomorrow. For example, composting not only diverts waste from landfills and returns nutrients to grow more, but would also even on the small scale of ¼ of CA farmland soak up ¾ of CA CO2 emissions. Many of these wide-reaching solutions extend to environmental justice and personal happiness. This is a really cool realization on your part; that the good we may do in decreasing carbon emissions with any given solution could also aid many other problems. It is important to make these connections because it can promote environmental protection in a way that appeals to many different interests. For example, renewable energy can decrease ghg emissions and can also save people money.

Once again, Ken's optimism and way of presenting what some would deem as 'crazy' solutions always makes me feel hopeful for the future.
      <br><Br>
I agree that the next wave of living style will be radically different than what our current standards are. Everything is moving to a more shared form factor. There are countless technologies that connect people's resources such as Airbnb, Uber and WeWork. I think the trend is beginning and it will bring a much more efficient and environmentally friendly mindset to more people. I also agree that micro-housing is the future and am equally excited about how it will play out during these test runs in major cities. Being a minimalist myself, I would seriously consider living in one if the rent was proportionally smaller. Whether for ecological reasons or not, I think most young people are becoming more comfortable with this idea of a more communal way of life. Although I don't see myself having a chicken coup, I agree that a lot of the ideas that he's mentioned are appealing to people.
      <br><Br>

However, there is one fact that I am always surprised that he does not mention. Perhaps it is due to the possibly depressing nature of this upcoming reality: many people will have to turn to this ways of life due to financial circumstances. I think the largest driver of these new communal markets and products will be economic downturn on just wave stagnations that will not allow individuals to live the same quality of life as in the past. For example Airbnb arose during the 2008 financial crisis because people were desperate to add any form of supplemental income, even if it meant renting out a room in their house. Hopefully adoption and an increase in popularity of these lifestyles will happen before it becomes the only real option for some people so that it doesn't appear as poor status symbol.

"Being the Change" was definitely a somewhat empowering film to watch,  and it really made me take into perspective all that I've done and what I'm currently doing and how they come into play with the environment. Watching Kalmus drastically reduce his personal gas emissions really made it seem possible to help the planet in the long-run. The film as a whole definitely gave me a lot to consider in terms of my own carbon footprint and effect on the environment in general. The film made me feel that I could make a greater effort to limit the way my lifestyle impacts the encore not, but it also made me think about the people that are not as privileged to be able to make the changes that Kalmus made or that I could make. Though the documentary gave a lot of interesting views on how to diminish one’s carbon footprint, it also fails to take into consideration some limitations that could come with living such a unique and dynamic lifestyle. The film also did a great job at attacking the main perpetrator of negative carbon emissions--corporations, which suck a lot.

I agree, I think that this film offers very interesting perspectives on adapting to the climate crisis while still going after corporate perpetrators. By framing the issue through multiple lenses, from dumpster divers to climate activists to scientists, we are able to get a fuller picture of how much we’re really wasting and how damaging our lifestyles are. 

      <br><Br>

Even something as simple as throwing something away, or owning and using a toilet, completely reorients our view on things ‘going away’. Many of these impermanent things, possessions, property, etc., really just puts a damper not only our climate, but how we see the world. We don’t see what the earth already gives us as inherently valuable, which very very negatively contributes to our behavior and treatment of our planet. 

      <br><Br>

Seeing various smaller capitalistic enterprises, like the Repair Cafe in Pasadena, are excellent examples of how we don’t need to upend our system in order to stimulate positive change. Though I believe there are many things about our economic and political systems that need to be fixed, if the folks within our systems are choosing to focus on not just profit but more of a triple bottom line, there’s a huge potential for doing good things for our environment.

Watching this film was very interesting because when I think of people who are involved in greatly reducing their emissions, I typically think of single individuals who are only responsible for themselves. It is so much easier to reduce one’s emissions if you only have to think of yourself because you only have your responsibilities, while if you have a family you have to plan a schedule that is environmentally friendly for everyone. This is made especially difficult if someone has children because children (prior to the age of 10 or 12) cannot necessarily travel alone (on public transportation). It was really inspiring to see a family reduce their emissions so drastically, when I think of my own family and siblings I had always imagined drastically reducing emissions would be near impossible.
      <br><Br>

 Overall, I found the film useful and I would love to incorporate some of the practices into my own life. I do not currently have a car but I think it would be interesting to attempt to convert one in the future if one is necessary. I like the idea of not being trapped in emitting enormous amounts of carbon dioxide if I eventually need a car (for now I shall just use my bike). While I do not think I will ever really want to incorporate an outdoor bathroom compost, it was very interesting to know that it could be done safely.

I appreciate how personal this week's film was. I also like how they stressed so much that each individual's impact is only a drop in the bucket, but when many individual's personal impacts on the climate change are added up, together they are substantial. While encouraging individuals to progressively make more changes in the way they live one step at a time, I appreciated the examples they provided for how one can reduce their emissions in ways they probably wouldn't otherwise think of. The most surprising of these was the humanure idea. Anyways, I thought this film was a good call to action for the average citizen. It wasn't overly pushy, and it didn't need to be.

I agree with you on the fact that the film was intended to reach out to the average person. The idea that was to change somebody's impact in a slight way was genius in my opinion, as its something that everyone can visualize and see as an opportunity to make a difference. I feel that a problem with much of the climate media's approach to personal consumption much to radical for the average American to change their lifestyle. However, this film gave a window do an easier, more convenient way to reduce climate impact on a small individual scale, but also on a large social scale.

The Documentary Being the Change: Live well was interesting. Its crazy how much people are willing to change when they have children. Peter and his partner were willing to change how his career because he wanted to make a difference. He wanted a better future for his children well more like he wanted a future for his children. This documentary is just a reminder that it is never to late to make personal changes that will address the climate crisis and impact it in a good way. Having children really changed the perspective on his life and life in general. Both he and his wife made changes. I really like how they talk about mediating and Casa De Paz. Meditating and finding an escape that way is really beneficial especially in today’s world. Casa de Paz is crazy in a good way. Pancho who I believe was in charge of casa de Paz looked so carefree. All he wanted to do was to sever others and make a positive change in the world. The Repair Café I think is a really cool idea. I think that is a really good idea this would be a way to reduce waste. By that, I mean a step in the right direction because the repair café wouldn’t be enough to address climate change. I do believe that you could be happy if you change your lifestyles. I feel like personal change is very much needed in our society. I do believe that once you have what you need anything extra does not really make you happy in the long run,

I agree with your comment. Peter really did a great job showing how daily change can reduce carbon emissions. It’s really shocking that he reduced his carbon emission from 20 tons to 2 tons. We could learn from him. If he can do it, many of us can make it. Once everyone makes the same goal as he did, the world will have a huge change. But just like you said in comments, based on different social and economic backgrounds, not everyone fit the same method as Peter introduced. But the one better off on the materialistic life who contributed to the most amount of carbon emission should use the method.

I truly appreciate the hopeful tone of this documentary in comparison to some of the others which took a more dire and position. Though Kalmus makes it evident that he and his family have made hundreds of changes to their lifestyle in terms of their carbon footprint, none of these changes seem extremely drastic or unrealistic, which I find to be very uplifting as it shows that anyone has the capability to make some, if not all, of the same changes. While Kalmus is adamant that climate change is here, and its effects will only continue to grow and become more catastrophic, I found that his main message was that rather than mourn the earth, one must learn to accept it, and choose whether or not they want to be a part of the change that must occur. Another aspect of the film that I admired was his belief in the power of individual action. Many other films have conveyed the idea that it is only the wealthy and powerful who can truly create benevolent change regarding climate change, yet Kalmus reiterates the idea that structural change begins on the individual level, as it is this which will influence policy makers and world leaders.
      <br><Br>
I also found it interesting that the film focused on physical and spiritual ways in which Kalmus and his family address climate change. Though I've never thought of meditation as a way to combat global warming, I do see that the spiritual benefits allow for a stronger connection to the earth, and other people, which in turn can affect the way in which one believes in themselves to make change. Kalmus's vegetable oil-car is another extremely original idea I've never heard of, but also one which seems so effective, I wonder why it isn't a more widespread practice.
      <br><Br>
Though I don't think I'll be adopting the practice of "humanure", I do feel as though many of Kalmus's lifestyle changes are easily accessible, and will hopefully influence the way I live my life now, and in the future.

<p>
While watching Being the Change, I was inspired by the Kalamas family's way of life. It is notable that Peter and his wife were both Harvard grads and that Peter worked for NASA as a climate scientist. Obviously, these two are very bright; they could've used their wisdom to climb up the corporate ladder and find extreme economic success, like many smart people do. Yet, Peter and his wife are caring, conscientious, and wise people who decided that leading a sustainable life is the answer to how they can combat the climate crisis. It was extremely helpful to see their day to day lives, because it can show those who are intimidated by leading sustainable lives how easy it really is. Once you make the first change, it seems much easier to make the rest. I feel like the Kalamas family is representative of families in the future, once climate change is collectively recognized. We must look to them for guidance, since they are years ahead of the rest of us. Something else I noticed was how happy the family was while leading this lifestyle. It shows you do not need excess to feel a certain amount of joy, and that very little can be in a way refreshing to the daily grind of work and school. Adapting to these simplicities like walking or biking instead of driving, eating plant based whole foods, and living in a more confined space are shown to be extremely doable, if not more effective than the average American life. This film inspired me to lead a much more sustainable life more than all of the other videos Ken has assigned, because I was able to see the day to day lives of people who value sustainability.

I too thought the film was truly inspiring and it encouraged me to do whatever I can to help the environment and how every person can do what they can in their own specific way that fits best into their lifestyle. One thing that I think was really interesting was the whole process of saving waste and how much grocery stores throw out just because the packaging is a little bit messed up or past the sell-by date. I don't think I personally could ever get into the type of life that the Kalamas family lives, and I don't think many people could fully commit as they do, but I think we can all learn from them and do whatever we can. Most of the things that we do to help limit our carbon emission aren't actually that life-changing, and if you surround yourself with people who support and will help you, it only makes it easier. This film is incredible for depicting a large variety of steps that can be taken to help make a positive impact on our environment and hopefully encourage people to take a first step towards living a more sustainable lifestyle. I would 100% recommend "Being the Change" to anyone who is wondering what they can do to help out in the climate crisis in terms of their own personal action.  However, I would still remind people to get out and support activism and vote! Making significant changes in the climate crisis will take a lot of work and a ton of commitment for people all over the world who want to make a change and create a livable world for future generations to come.

I have watched both Demain and Being the Change, but I decided to comment on Demain because that was one of my favorite environmental films. I feel like, with environmental films, there's a fine line between making the film truthful to the current state of our environment but horribly depressing and making a film full of positive fluff with only a few dependable facts sprinkled in. Demain truly is able to walk this line by making the viewer feel positive while also  translating the urgency in which we the viewers need to act on our climate crisis. It shows us the good things happening throughout the earth that are working to end climate change, which, in turn, inspires the viewer and gives the viewer hope that we CAN change our wasteful ways.

In World history class in middle school, I remember learning about the caste system in India. For anyone who isn’t knowledgeable about the caste system, it is essentially a social structure in India which placed people in higher/lower social stature based on their families background/education level/bloodline. Even now, in certain rural areas, the caste system is still fairly prevalent in how people may treat each other (since the caste system doesn’t really exist anymore). Because of this knowledge, I thought it was really great that the upper and lower castes in the village in India were able to work together to solve problems  that affect all of the village residents.

Heads, hand, heart. That’s what we should be focused on so i agree with him. The learning part of the video is inpiring because I always wanted to stop what I was doing and learn as many things as i could. Like the man and his family, there is more value to life when you do more and a lot of that has to do with saving the planet and should be a system. I agree that the bystander effect is extremely harmful in making a change to the environment and I feel guilty about that all the time. It almost seems like a disorder to not believe in climate change. I did like the Carbon fee and dividend idea that he wishes could be implemented because everyone would essentially earning and recieving what they put in in terms of carbon emissions. It sounds extremely fair to me. Picking food from the trash is disturbing just considering the germs and such so i didn’t enjoy that part too much, but i do agree that being a “normal” person should mean making something good out of the world and striving for environmental change. Being rich and poor shouldn’t be a decider of wealth. Happiness and purpose in utilizing resources is a stronger form of power to me

As I watched Being the Change, I was incredibly inspired by Peter. This film was very personal to me because he films in Pasadena, a city right next to my own hometown. As he speaks of the climate activist groups in the area, I was surprised because I had no idea there were so many organizations near my area. The film shows him driving down Colorado Blvd to pick up vegetable oil from a sushi restaurant so that he can use that in place of diesel fuel. Seeing his journey in a town that I grew up so close to made me realize that taking action is not as daunting as it may seem. Making a difference sometimes seems almost unattainable because we don't know where to start or what to even begin with. However, seeing that Peter was making so many changes in his lifestyle in a suburban area that I am very familiar with made me realize that "being the change" is not unattainable or impossible--you just have to utilize your resources in your community. As citizens of the developed world, we have so many resources around us that we may not be aware of. I personally had no idea that you could go to a restaurant and ask for their vegetable oil (that would originally be wasted) to use as fuel for your car. Not only are you being greener, you're also saving gas expenses. Another point that I thought was interesting was the fact that his changes were wallet-friendly. Usually, when we think of "being the change," expensive luxuries come to mind, such as Teslas and solar panels. But, Peter conveys that being environmentally friendly does not have to come with a hefty price tag--in fact, it can save you a lot of money. This film was riveting in a way that made it extremely relatable to me. I know that "being the change" is completely possible if you look for ways to cut back your carbon emission. You don't need to spend thousands of dollars on new solar panels to reduce your emissions because the answer might be in your own backyard.

This comment was very well worded. I agree that this film made the thought of me myself “being the change” much less daunting. I also appreciated that Kalmus showed very accessible ways to be the change. Going off your example of using leftover oil from local restaurants that would have been wasted otherwise, Kalmus shows an easy and money saving way to reduce your emissions. Yes, he had to tweak his engine and his car a little. But, when I first got my car, my parents changed the tank to take regular instead of premium gasoline to save money in the long run. This is no difference and will save exponentially more money! To your point of thinking that being the change is only in the hands of the rich, I agree. It's frustrating to perceive the wealthy as the ones who can make the most change with their wealth and status and then turn on Instagram and see them flaunting a new car or purse each week and jetting off to new locations twelve times a year. This film also helped with that. We cannot leave it up to the billionaires, and we don't have to! We can make the differences we want to see reflected in the values our society holds and we can make waves ourselves. We don't have to wait for “influencers’ and that was a great realization to have.

After watching "Being the Change," I learned that one's actions and responsibilities can really affect the world and influence other people to do the same in the future. I believe that it is extremely impressive that Kalmus reduced the amount of carbon gas emissions from 20tons to 2(?) tons with so much efforts. His efforts will definitely help the environment and has inspired to do the same in the future. I remember from a previous assignment in this course, that I commented that "it really takes a spark to create a fire." And from the film, I realized that Kalmus is one of the best examples who demonstrates that idea because he is the spark himself. I hope that other people were very impressed and inspired like I was after watching the film because I learned a lot from this film and this course all together.

I think your quote, “It really takes a spark to create a fire,” is an excellent quote for this film. I remember watching Being the Change for the first time last quarter and I felt like that is what it did to me. Seeing that Kalmus cut his carbon footprint to 2 metric tons encouraged me to try to do the same. I am eager to try to cut my carbon footprint down as much as I can. Ken argues that taking political action is more important than personal action, but I think this shows that personal action can matter a great deal. People like Kalmus can help motivate people to make changes in their own lives, causing a chain reaction, or a spark to create a fire. 
      <br><Br>
Tomorrow is one of my favorite films that we have watched. I really like their section on agriculture and looking at how crops can create an ecosystem. I like the idea that if we make the change today, it’ll be better tomorrow.

After watching the documentary film “Being the Change”, I was really impressed and surprised to see there is people who can live sustainably like this in California. There is a scene attracts my attention in the film that it says “the more you live sustainably, the more happier you are.” I totally agree with this statement because every time I do something environmental friendly such as planting trees and flowers, I do feel happier. In this film, Peter is such a successful person in sustainable living. After understanding what he did or sacrifice for this lifestyle, to be honest, I do not think I am ready for this yet. First of all, I’m fanboy of the super cars, which determines that I am not environmental friendly at all. Before I take this class, I was thinking to get a Tesla for my daily driving so that I can emit less carbon. On the other hand, after I knew producing a Tesla makes a lot of pollution, I am now not sure I should buy it or not. Second, giving up taking the airplane is also unacceptable for me. Although sometimes we can do meetings through technology, it does not work all the time. For example, what if I want to go other places that takes much longer than taking a flight? Should I go back to China by boat? Even if there is a boat like this, it is going to be a luxury cruise, and it costs much more than a flight. The only thing that I think would work for me so far is plantation. I love plants and I think it is going to be a good way for me to start reducing my carbon footprints. This film also reflects the fact that once we start making one change, the rest is much easier to make.

I totally agree, I was also very impressed that people are living so sustainably in California. I was aware that people were growing their own food and composting and washing/drying their own clothes and so on. But to see the extent that people are going to is inspiring. There’s so much more to living sustainably than we tend to think. It’s a lifestyle change for sure. And luckily, just like the film reflects, once we start making a change the rest is so much easier to make! I do love that the more we live sustainably the happier we are. I think this is also true for when we do things environmentally friendly, because that is a part of living sustainably. Small things like planting flowers, picking up trash, biking instead of driving, and decluttering can make us happier. And the more we do it the happier we are. 
      <br><Br>
This often makes me wonder what our world would be like if we lived more sustainably. If we cared about everything around us instead of what could bring us profit I feel as though we would be much happier. Doing things for others and the environment gives us a sense of purpose. We are helping by doing things that align with our moral principles. Wanting to make things better so it can be better for everyone is a mindset that I think we should all adopt. It would lead to a change in our behaviors and make us prioritize our connection to the species and nature in this world instead of money and fame. We need to get rid of the ideology that things are already so bad that it’s not worth trying to fix. We should always be working to fix things. And by taking small steps we can do so. By riding our bikes to work, eating more sustainably, wasting less, consuming less, and by voting for people who can make systematic changes that will stop oppressing and exploiting people. 
      <br><Br>

Of course we can not fix everything on our own. We need each other and we need bigger changes. Of course it’s harder and more of an inconvenience to do so sometimes because it is made this way. Sp we must do what we can to change it. Like for you, you can’t go without a plane. But you could take the train for the most part, except for going overseas. There are boats that aren’t luxury that will transport people. Greta Thunberg took a zero emissions boat to the U.S. when she came to New York. So it can be done, but it’s an inconvenience. We need that to change. Not only do we need the transportation system to be upgraded, but we need to decrease the amount of purpose that we travel. If traveling by boat is only an inconvenience because of how long it takes then we need to simply make more time to make the trip, leave earlier. And if there isn’t enough time for that then is your presence really necessary? We need to really think about what we’re doing and if it’s necessary or if we can skip it and save time/money/emissions.



<br><hr>
Great comment! At the beginning of the video, there’s a statement I think can illustrates the whole content of this film, that is “Our action goes far deeper than what we can say with words”. Personally, like Peter, I also have wondered what I can do to make this world a better place. As you said in the comment, I think compares to Peter’s action about saving the environment, ours are far from enough. I believe that I found something that is amazing about Peter, that is, he has that kind of courage that we don’t have. When he wanted to move to a place that is closer to the environment, he did it, even though that means he had to give up something as consequence. Same as you mentioned in the comment, giving up the benefits that are offered by modern tech and transportation can be hard for many people, for them, doing so means can be time consuming and have less welfare in life. That’s why I admire people like Peter, because they did what others can’t.

"The more you live sustainably, the more happier you are" has positively moved me as well. Because of the environment needs us to protect and it won rehabilitate itself due to the man-caused damages to it. We cannot be like Peter, but we can do what can to help the climate is not bad as well. Like plants is your way of showing improving the environment. Even though Ken talks about many ways to improve the environment, but I disagree with vegetarian eating habits and give up taking the planes.  Just as you think, those things are impossible to give up. The film talks about Transition Pasadena, and I used to go to school there. And each year school organized us to clean up the trash on the side of the highway in Pasadena or to clean up the beach. I have done both in the past, and I think that is my way of helping the environment to be better. Everyone's ability is limited, we just need to do the best that we can and I think that is enough for now.

This weeks film was very interesting. I liked how the film started out with a quote that read, “My actions are my only true belongings.” This has a very deep and powerful message that the more you re-read it the more meaningful it gets. This film also introduced a lot of things I didn’t even know were possible. For example, the car that he converted to run on vegetable oil. I don’t know much about care, actually I know nothing about cars so when I heard that I didn’t believe it. I didn’t think that was even possible , and the fact that it can go 100 miles to UC Irvine is actually insane to me. 100 miles of zero emissions. Another thing I thought was crazy was the humanity. An outside toilet he created that uses human feces to basically create soil for vegetables and fruits to grow. Which is pretty disturbing but also cool at the same time if that makes any sense. One last thing that was crazy to me was the man who dumpster dives. I have seen and heard about people dumpster finding and always found it so disgusting but the amount of food he got out of it was crazy. It just shows how much we waste perfectly good food and how we need to change our ways.

I also resonated with that quote that you mentioned. I think that message is so powerful because its true. For many people what we did in this life is what we will be remembered by rather than the stuff we own. Kalmus's modified car is an amazing example of using technology in a way that we don't commonly think about because it is somewhat regressive in the fact that his car can't go as far as a petrol fueled car could, however his ingenuity has cause it to not emit carbon, while also reusing oils that would end up being thrown away. Kalmus's really embodies reusing items as a way to live a sustainable lifestyle. Most of the topics he bring up in the film are examples of him reusing items that other people would've cast out. Overall the message of the film counters what is commonly thought about living a simpler lifestyle. I would argue that Kalmus has to work more for his lifestyle as it requires more steps and things to do to mantain, but it seems like it is worth it.

The film Being The Change does a great job reflecting the situation of climate change from a new perspective. At the start of the film when Peter Kalmus reflects that he greatly struggles with anxiety due to the current situation (at the time) regarding climate change. Due to his expansive knowledge as a climate scientist, Peter was able to see for himself clearly the effects of anthropogenic climate change and peek into the future for his kids. I thought the film did an excellent job of portraying the overwhelming anxiety that he felt by the background noise that was piercing through my ears at this point in the movie. It genuinely made me uncomfortable and I just wanted the sounds to be over. His use of meditation to combat his anxious tendencies is inspiring in addition to his own individual actions to live more sustainably with his family. When Peter was explaining the individual effect of each person’s change in actions it strengthened my belief in my own influence. At times I really struggle with making decisions that I know are more sustainable from simple cravings to traveling home. It is so easy just to downplay my own individual influence because yes, the plane will still fly without me and that burger will still exist if I do not eat it. The way he frames the issue of individual actions and their impacts is very inspiring. It is crazy that Peter took the initiative to create his own car that runs in a way that is more sustainable and he was able to just do that on his own. I greatly admire that Peter and his family live every day of their lives devoted to doing everything that they can. From making music about climate change to only having two kids even though they really wanted a third, the way that they live their lives is astonishing. The Citizens Climate Lobby among all of its other purposes serves almost as a support group for those that feel as if they are struggling to create change from their actions alone. This comes full circle because truly no one can do this alone. I believe that individual action is not only as important as collective action but within itself individual action is collective action. With so much food waste produced everyday I really wonder why all companies, restaurants and other producers of food waste that are so concerned with their economic revenue do not just produce less food. The waste is not only bad for the environment but bad for their own revenue. They had to pay someone to produce that food, package it and do whatever else needed for it just to end up in the garbage.

The moment he started talking about the avocado tree, I could tell that this documentary would be different from some others we've watched. It felt more personal and targeted toward America, specifically toward California. 
      <br><Br>

The film emphasized that there's a difference between wealth (phantom wealth) and true wealth multiple times. Most people see wealth as means to happiness, but there are kinds of wealth that are happiness. Serving others was mentioned, and that reminds me of how people are so disconnected in our culture. We don't consider serving others as most important.
      <br><Br>

When someone imagines the traditional image of a farmer, they don't seem too rich. Yet, the documentary stated that normal people can't afford to farm. It makes sense because land is expensive and machinery and seeds don't come out of nowhere. Yet, I find it a bit sad that the average person can't farm. There's a difference between farming and enough food to sustain yourself, but there's still a connection. Most people couldn't grow enough food to sustain themselves if they tried, much less their family. We're dependent on a few farmers for our sustenance. With our system, if a few farms fail, then millions of people could be affected. In a way, this reminds me of how people became dependent on wages. Instead of having control over our lives, we're being controlled.

Indeed this documentary did feel a lot more personal especially being born and raised here. I thought it was interesting how they talked about the differences in the notions of wealth between people. I often consider myself a very sympathetic and helpful person to those who are in need of me. I feel the homeless people in IV after every work shift I have because I figure why not give them the food that they can't get when I can get food. 
      <br><Br>
Although physical wealth does make some happy, I think a lot of people can depend on other things to be happy. Im personally thankful that seeing happiness in others is enough for me to be happy myself. 
      <br><Br>
this goes hand in hand with the climate crisis. So many people in denial of the climate crisis depend on fossil fuel money for support and happiness for their very expensive lives.

I found this film interesting because it was very different from all the other films we have watched. It was not about the facts of climate change, it was about the mentality surrounding these facts and how we can respond to them. I found this to be very helpful and thought-provoking. It was inspiring to see how Peter was able to find so much meaning in his life through his journey to reduce his CO2 footprint. He also inspired his family and others in his community to make changes and find similar meaning, which I think is very important. I also liked how he touched upon the idea that individual action is important. I think that one of the biggest obstacles in the fight against climate change is that so many people feel that their individual actions will not make a difference. As shown by Peter, we can make a difference. He reduced his carbon footprint immensely because of his own, independent actions and actually saved money by doing so. He made it clear that you do not need to spend money to make a difference, which I think is an important message to spread.

I enjoyed how detailed the this was, and various topics covered are helpful to people with different lifestyles.

This reading was definitely different from the usual readings for the class. It was more of an informative list, and I really appreciate the simplistic format of the piece.Maintaining livestock requires an abundance of resources, from water, feed, and land. Not only is it expensive to maintain, but the treatment practices of these animals are not regulated. People treat the animals very poorly, and abuse isn't uncommon in the meat industry.
      <br><Br>
Food is a fundamental aspect of our lives, and we simply cannot live without constantly fueling ourselves. When Ken asks if we are the "architects" of the future, I began to question what I am doing to help solve the climate crisis. I believe that switching to a plant based diet is an important step towards the right direction. I began eating vegetarian once or twice a week, and hopefully eat more plant based meals.
      <br><Br>
I believe that taking small steps are more important than taking drastic and unsustainable lifestyle changes.

In “Being the Change”, Kalmus undergoes personal changes to his lifestyle in order to reduce his carbon footprint drastically. And it works. He reduces it to 1/10th of what it was before he started becoming an activist. While his reduction does not do much in the grand scheme of climate change, it goes to show that everyone is capable of their carbon footprint without having to sacrifice all of the enjoyment in their lives. The part that interests me the most is when he bought the eggs that would have been thrown out because one had been cracked. This helps reduce our food waste, which is much higher than it should be because of how many people are starving out in the world. Many places throw out perfectly good food when it is no longer considered sellable, and many of them even go to great lengths to ruin it because they do not want to incentivize people to wait for the right time and then just take free food. I consider it quite sad that we have to create so much food waste because of the potential for a select few to abuse the system. We have enough food to feed the entire global population, yet we waste most of it here in the U.S.. I hope that reducing food waste can be brought more to the forefront of the peoples’ minds because it is one of the most important things we can be doing in order to fight the injustice in the world.

Being the change was such an interesting documentary, it was enlightening to see how seemingly normal it was for him and his family to live a life with such a small carbon footprint. The relatively small steps that he has taken really make it seem completely doable. For instance, converting your car to run vegetable oil is one way to substantially reduce your carbon footprint. This also solves a problem that restaurants face with excess oil from cooking being thrown away and causing further damage. Other things that his family and the environmental community has normalized, I admire, but the human compost in my opinion is a bit too extreme for me. Commendable, but not something that I could see becoming normalized. I believe that environmentalists get a somewhat bad wrap because the public sees their lifestyle choices as a challenge to their consumer identity. It is becoming increasingly possible for people to use less wasteful modes of transportation such as biking and public transportation. There are definite limitations however with this, because in many places in the world there is no infostructure in place to help bikers. In places like Copenhagen and Denmark, there are dedicated bike lanes, protected by cars and this has resulted in massive use of bikes for transportation. The most difficult challenge that climate activists face is to win over the public perception of being environmentally conscious. As we live currently, we throw away 1/3 rd of all food produced, and when our phones and other things break, we buy a new one instead of trying to fix the perfectly good ones we have. Until problems of this nature are resolved, I doubt we can move forward.

In my eyes, Being the Change had a very captivating beginning. I like how he opened the discussion of life without fossil fuels with the idea that he practices meditation. When I think of meditation I think of feeling peacefulness and content with life. Therefore, by going in depth that he is a practitioner of meditation, as a reader I associated his life with fossil fuels as peaceful and content.  It was really inspiring seeing Peter Kalmus and his friends live such selfless lives. Nothing they did was for themselves, it was all for others. What is so crazy about this is that they seemed so happy serving others. It just goes to show that life is not all about having the most possessions or the most clout, its about the mark you will leave when you are gone. It is important to positively influence the most people you can while you’re still here. The most important way to do this is to live an environmentally friendly life. As the documentary states, it is easy to transition to this way of life one step at a time.

I think you are very much correct, "Being the Change" really did have a captivating beginning, exploring the connection between our individual actions and society's crisis. The main character, Peter, was truly an individual that was acting for his own good, his family's good, and society's good. He was also an actor for the future generations, changing his current lifestyle with the goal of preserving the world for his children and the future posterity.
<br><br>
I think the changes that he made to his life were especially inspiring and creative. Driving a car that runs on veggie oil waste. Using the humanure toilet and compost system. Scouring for food in order to reduce food waste produced. I truly applaud his sacrifices of what is normally considered a "better" life for what he really believes in. It's just that, most Americans would not be willing to make this kind of drastic change to their lives for climate change. They would view it as an extreme inconvenience that is not worth it. 
<br><br>
Like you said, I think this documentary gave an insightful look into a person's determination, selflessness, and actual change for the better of the environment. In the last few weeks, we have talked about the different ways we would reduce our footprint, but had not seen anyone do it. Peter truly shows everyone how it is and can be done.



<br><hr>

Thus, people really don’t have to be like Thoreau and Yuanming Tao to live far away from the urban. Instead, minimalism is good enough to be environmental friendly. It’s just some simple changes in life. For example, use bikes or on foot when going out instead of taking the cars. Consumer less meat. Reduce food waste. These small changes are not hard but they influence a lot. A lot of people may be scared when they heard about Thoreau’s Walden, but protecting the Earth really don’t have to be in that way. Just keep our own lifestyles and make little changes will be enough.

<br><hr>
I also found it inspiring to see Kalmus and his friends living sustainable lives and also helping out others. It really gave me hope for society and our future. We need more people like them. We need more people to show that is possible to live sustainably and it is actually cheaper. 
<br><br>
I think that one reason people don't change their habits and move to more sustainable ways of living is because they believe that they alone cannot solve this issue of climate change. They need to know that everything they do does make an impact. If they decide to fix something that's one less item that does to the dump. If they decide to bike or walk that's less emission released into the atmosphere. Although their impact is not even to help the climate crisis at all, they might inspire others to follow in their steps. We need to show people that it is easy to change and they can simply start by buying less and keeping products longer. 
<br><br>
I also liked that Kalmus showed that you can still have a car as long as it runs on vegetable oil. I know that there is no way my family would be able to live without a car. My siblings both participate in numerous after school activities and a car is my only way to get home.

<br><hr>
I agree with the idea that every little change matters because if they are integrated together, it will not be little change. It can really reshape the reality. Thus, everybody should take part in the change. Change the lifestyles, live a more sustainable life, become more eco-friendly, etc. I suggest reduce the use of private cars. Rather, use more bikes and commute on foot more. The off-gases of cars are very harmful to both the atmosphere and human health. Meanwhile, commute on foot is one exercise to keep fit. Also, there is less carbon footprint.<br><hr>

The film "Being the Change" follows the life of Peter and his family, who manage to significantly reduce their carbon emission to about 1/10th of an average American's carbon emission. This documentary was really motivational and inspirational for me. A previous film about minimalism showed me that it was indeed possible to live a minimalist yet self fulfilling life, but the people of the documentary uprooted their life and made drastic changes to their lifestyle that kind of made it seem unrealistic for me to do. Peter however, makes small, simple yet fulfilling changes that seems possible for everyone, including me to do, like choosing to ride a bike, becoming vegetarian, etc, and by the end, he was able to reduce his carbon emission to 2 metric tons, which is what the ideal carbon emission for a human should be. The fact that he does this while living in a city, and not in the middle of nowhere, makes it seem more achievable too. Peter is an example of how one can live a happy life using very little carbon, an example that we should, and I want to follow.

What I found most interesting about the film “Being the Change” was the point of view of looking at change through the grassroots level from the bottom up. The small, yet intentional and well thought out actions of Peter and his friends were truly inspiring as an example of how to enact change from the bottom up through taking direct action. Peter showed me what it looks like for an environmentalist to walk the walk and talk the talk as he displayed his lifestyle and life choices as well as showed some of what his friends and colleagues were doing with their lives as well. I think two of the most interesting lifestyle choices that intrigued me were Peter’s conversion of his diesel car into a car that uses vegetable oil and their outdoor shower and bathroom that used Joe Jenkin’s toilet invention which reuses human waste in an effort to foster a cycle of reusing nutrients in a cycle of life. The car shocked me because instead of buying an expensive new electric car, Peter used what he already had which was an older modeled car and transformed it with his own hands into a car that runs on reused vegetable oil after the engine of the car  reaches a certain temperature threshold at which he flips a switch that turns the fuel from diesel to vegetable oil. Not only does this modification of Peter’s car clearly benefit the environment as he is able to drastically reduce his personal emissions but Peter also gets gratification from turning the switch and knowing that his hard work paid off. He also mentioned how he felt like an astronaut as he flips the switch to transfer over from diesel to vegetable oil. This transformation of Peter’s personal life and decision to not use a diesel guzzling car exemplifies the overall theme of the film which is that not only is it possible to live an environmentally friendly and sustainable life but it can also be gratifying and make one happier and more fulfilled than a wasteful and materialistic and stereotypical western lifestyle. Another two sections of the film that stood out to me were Pancho’s Casa de Pas in Oakland as well as the repair cafe which both exemplified local, community based solutions which bring communities together while promoting environmental sustainability. This film goes to show you that one’s actions can make a difference in addressing climate change, improving one’s lifestyle and one’s own happiness while influencing their community in a way that creates environmental change from the bottom as a grassroots movement.

 I agree that watching Peter and his friends was truly inspiring! I know in class we learned that personal action is not enough to change the world but I really appreciated how these guys truly became the change that they wish to see in the world. I really enjoyed watching this film because it showed how these personal actions were not just for the greater good of the planet but also for themselves. i think this film highlights how our current realty and its addiction to consumption has created added stress and unhappiness. peter is a great example of how doing things that better your community and the planet will make you a happier person. I really enjoyed seeing how small groups of people in his community are making local change. I agree that seeing him fix up his car to run on vegetable oil was really interesting! I think our world would be really different if it became “cool” to have an old car that ran off vegetable oil. Something that I thought was really interesting was his friends repair café. I am someone who likes to go to thrift stores and there is always a large section of old outdated appliances that sit there with dust and will most likely never be bought. Seeing how that women turned a café spot into a community center was truly amazing. I think it would be great if we could see more places implement this same practice as the repair café. I think this is a great example of being the change you wish to see in the world and also a way to get the community involved in a way that also betters the planet. Particularly what I thought was so great about this film was how all of these inspiring people were friends of peters. I think this a great example of why you should surround yourself with like-minded people and use those connections to help better your community. 
 
<br><br>
Overall, this has been one of my favorite films to watch. I really appreciated how the film incorporated the practice of meditation and how to relates to our consumption. Particularly when he explained that when we feel bad we give that feeling to someone else almost like a “gift”. Meditation can fix this because it forces you to reflect and see where that bad feeling is coming from and can stop you from giving that to others. I think this connects to what we are learning about it class. In order to make the huge life style changes that we as a society need to make we need to first be happy with ourselves and not base our happiness off of materialistic items. Once we have established inner happiness we can make the big changes to help others and create the change we wish to see.


<br><hr>
I couldn't agree more with you about the importance of making our own changes and helping others make changes that reflect the change we want to see in the world. Especially in today's society where people feel disconnected and cut off from the political process, making changes to one's own life is often a great place to start when considering how to best address climate change and the problems that it poses to our society. I think that it is especially important for people to make these individual life changes as it can be these changes that inspire them to take further actions and begin to make an effort to change the lives around them in addition to their own individual practices. An example of this may be if someone is concerned about how the animal agriculture industry is hurting the planet and contributing greatly to deforestation, methane emissions, agricultural inefficiency, ect... but does not know what they could do to help the problem. If they take an active approach to changing their own life habits such as becoming a freegan, then later down the road becoming a pescatarian, then becoming a vegetarian, and them eventually possibly becoming a vegan this transition is much smoother and provides a rich experience that they can then share with others. Once they have seen how they made a difference by converting their own life patterns, one can then share their experience with others in their community and convince them to take that first step of seeing the problem with agribusiness and then seeing the need to become a freegan. If this chain reaction takes place and people are able to share their practices with friends and family than we together can create a movement of action that does not bank on politics to solve our problems. This is the kind of action that is shown in the film "Being the Change" through Peter's own life changes. However, just a disclaimer that despite the hopeful and optimistic nature of this potential solution it is still extremely important to engage in politics and fight for political change as voting and becoming an activist are two of the best ways to enact change in this country.

<br><hr>
In “Being the Change”, we see a family that lives gracefully without the use of fossil fuels in their own home. What Ken describes in his video is that we don’t really need fossil fuels, and in fact, can actually live a better life without them. He emphasizes this by repeating this mantra multiple times in order to really hit home to many of the listeners of the video. But, how plausible is it to even transition out of the lifestyle that depends so much on fossil fuels is even possible? I believe that it is not efficient to try and switch everyone to this lifestyle, and it is even Ken that claimed that the little things that we try to do might not even have that great of an effect on the climate at all. 
<br><br>


For example, if we look at the household actions that we commit, such as cooking, buying meat, and more, if EVERYONE on Earth were to switch and transition into a more climate change-conscious diet and lifestyle, then yes, there would be great change in the way that our climate works. Yes, we would probably do a great deal in combating climate change. But, how plausible is that? How likely is it that everyone on Earth, or even most people on Earth, completely switch their diet or eliminate the use of fossil fuels in their life? Not likely at all. So, the amount of people that are destroying the climate will always cancel out the people that have been living a “climatarian” lifestyle every time. 
<br><br>


So what is the solution? Look at what causes the most by targeting the reason why we have huge carbon emissions. Transportation industry, or the coal industry, or the manufacturing industry, or the agricultural industry. Yes, some of them have personal ties to what we do, as humans, in everyday life, but how can we possibly take them down if politicians continue to bring them up due to the funding that they receive from these large industries? Politics, as I have said multiple times, is this constant cycle; it's a positive feedback loop. So, what do we need to do to stop it? Elect politicians that will literally take those industries down; bring them down and do not allow them to take over what our world is coming to.

I really enjoyed watching the film “Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution”. I liked how the film did not just focus on Peter and how his family lives environmentally friendly, but it showed a lot of his friends that were all very diverse. I feel like by showing this to the audience, this gives people a lot of options on how they could change their lifestyle to help stop the climate crisis. The film also showed and made a lot of good points that many people watching might not have known about, like the amount of perfectly good food that we waste and how this one guy took all of that food out of the dumpster to show to people. I think the most important message of this film was about how these people in it are living very selfless lives. One man said that the secret to happiness is serving others and I think that we all need to start living these selfless lives because that is what is going to change this movement of stopping the climate crisis.

The part of your comment about how leading selfless lives is important to putting a stop to the climate crisis really stuck with me. I feel like it's true that much of the problems that have built up that we've talked about in this class have stemmed from greed and putting an individual's desires over others. The thought of people and industries's greed is such a stark contrast to the lifestyle that Peter and the others in this documentary lead. I agree that we should start leading more selfless lives. I feel like nowadays it's rare to see acts of generosity in our society when it is usually overpowered by the acts of corruption. I hope more people get the chance to see this documentary and rethink the way they lead their lives.

I also really enjoyed watching the film “Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution.” It was great that the film showed many people that live environmentally friendly lives and not just Peter and his family. I agree that by showing the lives of different people, the audience can see many different possible changes that they can make to help with the climate crisis. The guy that took out the perfectly good food from the dumpster to show people was something that really stuck out to me. I definitely do not think about the possibility of all the good food that is wasted and thrown out into dumpsters. I really like your takeaway from the film. These environmentally conscious people from the film are definitely also very selfless people. They are putting the environment and earth’s future above their own possible material wants and daily life convenience. The thing that the man in the film said about the secret to happiness being serving others really resonated with me. I definitely feel like some of my most joyful moments in my life were when I was focused on serving others instead of on meaningless material things in my life. Once people start giving up unnecessary material pursuits and put the environment and earth’s future above these things, there will be greater steps taken towards alleviating the climate crisis.

I watched the film Being the Change and I really enjoyed watching it as it showed real people living a life that was environmentally friendly and they did not look miserable at all which one would expect with a lifestyle that seems like you are depriving yourself from all the seemingly enjoyable aspects of life. However, seeing them live their lives and looking so happy, proud and at peace was really nice to see because in my mind and i'm sure in many others, that lifestyle does not seem as attractive as the lifestyle that we are convinced is what everyone should be living, which is buying bigger and more things which is incredibly wasteful. What I found really interesting from this film was how his car would run on discarded vegetable oil from restaurants and it would mostly work which was very surprising. As well as seeing how so much food is wasted for example in the film it showed that whole cartons of eggs were thrown out just because one or two eggs were broken within the carton which is so wasteful. Then seeing the man who went dumpster diving and pulled out perfectly good produce and food and showed it all displayed to see how much food is actually wasted. After watching this film I can see that living a simple and environmentally friendly is not a hardship and actually looks really peaceful. It's just really hard breaking from the mentality that has been forced on you since you were a kid that you should grow up and work a high paying job so you could afford to buy a nice car, a nice big house and then go on vacation to far away places and buy everything you wanted. But step by step hopefully we could break away from this mentality.

After watching the film Being the Change, I was happy that they showed how people could live simple lifestyles and still be happy. Like you mentioned, most people would assume that a life without many luxuries was just miserable, but Ken's lectures and this film really portray an accurate lifestyle of people who aren't reliant on so many fancy commodities and are able to just live their life. Also, we can get personal satisfaction that we are leading lives that aren't hurting the planet and lives that will keep the earth safe and well for our future descendants. When the film showed all the food wasted and the man going into the dumpster and finding a whole carton of eggs that was fine, it really put into perspective how much we waste, especially if we consider the number of people who do this every single day and with even more food. I can see why people would oppose a simple lifestyle because in their minds they work hard so they can enjoy the luxuries, but in my opinion, they should use those benefits to help better the earth and also use that income to take better care of themselves as people in other ways than excessive consumerism on luxuries. Hopefully we can soon transition our mentality to be more earth and climate-focused, and eventually we will be able to solve this climate crisis.

This film was interesting however not something I would recommend to others. Overall, I appreciated and liked the message that the film was trying to get across, that normal people can make small changes that will help the world as a whole. However, I believe the film could have done a better job of conveying their message. The story of Pancho in the Bay Area who runs his "House of Peace" was very up lifting. Through his story it was nice to see how one little community comes together to be happy and healthy. All the stories shown in the film were uplifting and did a good job of showing how small changes can give people tremendous amounts of happiness. Yet, most of the changes these people made into their lives just don't seem like something your average person could do. For example, Peter Kalmus used grease to power his car and made his transportation very energy efficient. Now this is something someone knowledgeable like Kalmus could do, but the average person would have neither the time nor the skills to do something like that. I think this movie would not interest many people because it does not show the overall impact of the actions of the people shown in the film. Their actions seem to only impact their lives and most people want to do things that they know will directly help the world but they also want the changes their making to be something easy.

This type of documentary typically provides a brand-new way of thinking. I think when Peter thinks and talks. The head means science. The hand means you do something by your hand like planting and getting on a bicycle. And the heart is where you find the meaning of life. I do believe that Peter did think about what are we doing now and where we going to go in the future and how can we do. Peter is a model for common people because he is not uncle Pete but a person who cares about the environment and makes personal changes. Then, the following content really makes me surprised me. Peter is really making changes. He drives a car with grease as a fuel. He rides a bike to his working place. He has spent around ten years to meditate and advocate more people to join him. Meditation brings him peace and think and be in nature. All of these actions correspond to the title of the documentary: “Being the change”. Peter has changed. Peter is changing and he is going to change in the future. I really appreciate his persistent and correct awareness which is Samma Sati. It is not easy to persist to live in green and try best to reduce carbon emissions. And I am happy to see that many other people like Peter are making changes also. Reducing food wastes in landfills cans or making a composting area and other changes that can sign to make a change. They are using hands to make a change which is the second one in Peter’s “head, hand, and heart”.

The assigned film this week was eye opening, seeing a family happily living a sustainable life is inspiring. When most people are told about solutions, they have to implement in their lives to solve the climate crisis, they see these solutions very negatively. Telling people to stop eating meat often leads to bad reactions about people who don’t want to stop eating the burgers they love so much. Telling them to give up their car means more trouble getting places and more time wasted in public transport. When you tell families to have smaller houses, they feel like they are going to be unhappily cramped in a tiny space. However, seeing what this family has been able to accomplish, only 1/10th of the carbon footprint the average American family emits is wonderful. Minimalism should not be seen negatively and living a life with less emissions and consumerism does not have to be miserable. We need to stop thinking that having less things means that we are not happy or wealthy. Our society has to change it’s way of thinking if we are to live sustainably in the future.

I think that Peter's lifestyle is incredibly inspiring. It takes a lot of self-awareness and pro-activeness to be able to acknowledge that one's lifestyle is flawed and put in work to change their habits. I love how he surrounds himself with those who think like him, and they are able to build a community that revolves around sustainability. I never knew that there were people who willingly fixed electronics and clothes for free simply out of the kindness of their hearts. This is rare in itself and I think that this community is very positive and helpful. However, something to note is that being able to surround yourself in this kind of community is an extreme privilege. Pasadena’s median income is upper-middle class and even Peter himself acknowledges that it was extremely hard to live sustainably when he first started off on a low income. I can’t help but think how difficult it may be for others to lead a similar lifestyle if it is so difficult to achieve in the first place. I think another factor that we should acknowledge is that he came to understand his large carbon footprint primarily due to the fact that he is educated. Education is a privilege in itself and is not easily accessible to everyone. I applaud Peter for being able to change his lifestyle into something more sustainable, and find a community that aims to do the same, but I can't help but think that it is too idealistic. Being able to live sustainably and the accessibility to sustainable resources are not mutually exclusive. To live such a sustainable lifestyle comes with many privileges— education wise and income wise. They are intertwined within one another and we can only achieve a sustainable planet if we, as a population, collectively find ways to educate those who may be in the dark and provide resources to kickstart a environmentally friendly lifestyle. I do agree that individual action is as important as collective action, but it’s even more powerful if we achieve those simultaneously.

I sufficiently enjoyed watching Tomorrow and learning of the various sustainable lifestyles that people lead across the world. I found myself being particularly intrigued by the small farm that was created from a desolate patch of land, being meticulously cultivated to fertility and later going on to produce thousands of dollars of produce in a tiny area. The densely packed plants almost looked like the Garden of Eden. I found it to be extremely interesting what the farmer had to say about the fact that there is only so much you can do with farming machinery and that working the soil by hand is far more effective. This makes a lot of sense as there is greater efficiency with farm equipment but far less precision and care. I was also really intrigued by the agriculture movement in Detroit as they made an effort to shift towards local farming throughout the city. It blew my mind to find out that food is typically grown 1500 miles from the place it is sold. I imagine it is unspeakable how this impacts the climate crisis in terms of production and transport. Because of this, growing food within the city will significantly lower the carbon footprint of Detroit. Additionally, I think it can foster a sense of community and add beauty to the city in spurts of lush foliage. Throughout the film overall, I found myself to be deeply appreciative of the restoration of abundance throughout various communities in the form of ethical farming and fresh produce.

After watching the “Being the Change”, I am so surprised that the concept of sustainable lifestyle. " the more you live sustainably, the more happier you are." In the other words, sustainable lifestyle can be expressed by green lifestyle such as one less day of driving, turning off the lights for one hour, one less fur product, saving one drop of water and one grain of food. In terms of one day for one person, the result is negligible. However, if one person can stick to keep green lifestyle during his or her whole life, the result is significant. We can imagine that if whole human beings can stick to keep this kind of green lifestyle, not only ourselves can achieve happiness but also the climate crisis can be alleviated. Because of the advanced technology, many convenient equipments are produced to help our life such as sweeping floor machine. The function of the machine can provide a family with a clean house, however, before we buying the machine, the production the assembly parts on the machine making a lot of pollution. The cost of green lifestyle is to reduce convenience in our life.

This was an inspiring film as it documented someone who followed through and changed his ways for the betterment of his environment, and he improved his personal life in the process. This film offers insight to the many tactics we can use to lead an eco-friendly, alternative lifestyle, from home-grown food and more environmentally friendly diet, to reducing your carbon footprint by changes your means of transportation. These changes are something that anyone can employ with just a bit of effort. His newly found ways do not include drastic, expensive changes, therefore, it can be replicated by those of any socioeconomic standing. The largest hindrance from making this for most individuals is their fear for loss of luxuries, yet Peter Kalmus was very content in his minimalist lifestyle and found more happiness knowing that his way of living proves beneficial to the environment.

<br><br>
I believe and hope that we could all implement this revolutionary change to some degree. Even the little things that we do will add up and strengthen the world around us. By doing so, we may eradicate some of the toxic aspects of our culture such as consumerism. By caring for the environment around you, you also gain more empathy for those around which only solidifies the communities and promotes growth in all facets.

I agree that the biggest takeaway from this documentary was that the changes that Peter and his family made in their lives were something that anyone could do with just a bit of effort and were inexpensive and feasible. While Peter has not radically changed every single thing about his life, he shows that even making whatever change you can make a huge difference (as Ken mentioned, he has been able to cut his carbon footprint to 1/10th of that of the average American). What I liked the most about this film was that Peter’s changes are realistic and allow him to still have a fulfilling and relatively normal suburban lifestyle. One major example of this is his approach to transportation. While him and his family try to bike and walk as much as possible, he acknowledges that it is almost impossible to have a normal life with two kids in LA without a car and has found an alternative that lets him still use his car when necessary (having a vegetable oil fueled car).
<br><br>



As you said, I hope that this documentary inspires people to at least make as many small changes as possible and that we can start rethinking the way our society looks at consumerism. Peter’s lifestyle gives me hope that we can still have a version of the suburban lifestyles we all grew up eventually wanting, without having to destroy our planet in the process.

After watching the documentary film "Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution or Tomorrow" I was very enlightened with how Kalmus does on a daily basis to reduce his carbon footprint. This is important to think about because I have never really seen anyone portray these solutions. This film shows him farming chickens, repairing old devices, hosting meditation, and tending to his humanure toilet. He's seen driving his old car collecting vegetable oil to power its engine and commuting to work on a bike. Seeing all the actions he does to reduce his carbon footprint, it somehow makes them more realistic and able to do. When having discussions about air travel and population control, he is very adamant about it. For example, the reason he does not fly any more because if fewer people fly then they will reduce air travel. In talking about technology he feels that society uses it primarily to solve problems. He introduces a more traditional approach to reduce your impact which is to just save money. And if choosing to spend their money then purchase solar panels and heaters. This approach shows that you do not need to be rich in order to make a difference.

I really appreciate the last part of your comment.  I think that in today's society a large portion of teenagers and young adults thrive to become rich.  They see having a large fortune as a true way to make an impact on the world and solve many problems, but in reality, a mass fortune can bring even more problems to one's life.  I enjoyed the film, “Being the Change” because it was very insightful.  I think many people can become overwhelmed by the climate crisis and even think that their individual efforts will not make a difference.  Watching the film, it became very clear that there are many things that we can do to contribute to the resolution of the climate crisis and they are achievable.  If each individual person would take a small part of their time to consider reducing their carbon footprint little by little it would become a collective effort.

I found this documentary quite interesting. The mid-beginning was a bit weird when it went into detail about meditation (without thoroughly explaining its explicit connection to the climate crisis and one's journey to living a more eco-friendly life) and composting using human waste. Out of all the eco-friendly choices, I think I am least likely to start composting my own human waste. It was also a little discouraging to see the documentary only focusing on this one main and his nuclear family. But, the documentary really hit its stride for the last part when community started to be the focus. Showing that many "normal" people in Pasadena, Altadena, and surrounding areas were joyously living eco-friendly lifestyles was the film's strong suit. Maybe because my grandparents lived in this area from the 1950s until their recent deaths and that my dad grew up in this area, but I really felt a connection to the community being shown. Each member had their own way of being more environmentally conscious from living in a house with lots of eco-friendly tech to starting a climate action advocacy group to getting together to repair broken items which prevents them from going to landfill. This was lovely to see. It proved that everyone can combat the climate crisis with their lifestyle in a way that is comfortable to them and that fits their needs and desires. Not only was this encouraging (I actually felt more optimistic about being able to mitigate the climate crisis after seeing this documentary since it gave me hope for what communities could look like in the future), but also I think it was inspiring. Showing the many different ways of a climate-friendly lifestyle definitely encourages them to adopt practices into their lives that reduce their carbon footprint.

I was really intrigued by the idea of having local currency so that the money circulates through the community and you know that every money you put into the community will eventually come back around. They mentioned that it would work well for a weak economy, like Greece, so it seems like a beneficial way to strengthen a community. On a similar note, Detroit urban farming and Incredible Edible in Todmorden, UK both introduced ways to strengthen the community while being environmentally sustainable. In Detroit, after the economy collapsed, many abandoned the city, so those left decided to grow their own produce. Keep Growing Detroit has 20,000 volunteers that help to feed the city. Incredible Edible plants produce throughout the city to make use of empty land and it allows people to talk about the produce together and bond. 
<br><br>

Furthermore, the film emphasizes that being more sustainable and knowing you have the power to take care of yourself, including growing your own food, gives you a sense of power and confidence. This empowers and inspires people to be more environmentally friendly, even when it takes effort. Agroecology and permaculture mean putting in more manual labor, but getting more out of it. For example, microfarms can produce just as much as large, industrial farms by using their own hands to care for the soil and produce instead of tractors.
<br><br>

Also, the film offers good solutions to the climate crisis and cutting carbon emissions, like the prison in France that uses inmates to farm. This teaches them valuable skills for future jobs while being sustainable. In San Francisco, they have trash cans for plants that they give to farms as compost. The film mentions that compost can save 3/4ths of carbon emissions in California because the plants are going back into the earth, where they should be.
<br><br>

The music in this film is heavily related to the themes, which causes an emotional response from the audience. The song playing over the images of the oil sands in Canada says “we have the power in our hands, what can we do now? Pull up our sleeves, make a move, do something we need”. Having this in the background makes the audience realize that they have influence and can take the initiative to make a change.

I too am very interested in local currency! I think one of the best things we can do for both the environment and communities is to encourage a local exchange of goods and services. Not only does that limit transportation, but it boosts ethics. You are much less likely to abuse your neighbor as a worker than someone countries away. Local currencies do that in such a natural way that and they even promote flow over hoarding.
<br><br>
I know that the best place to live for the environment is a city, and if I live in a city you can bet I will engage in urban farming. Gardening is not only good for the planet, but it's a form of meditation. And I feel like that way to get away is so necessary when you live in the city. Teaching gardening skills to kids is also important, as we need to raise the next generation to be climate warriors.
<br><br>
The idea of being connected to what you do is so integral to a healthy community and mindset, and it helps the environment too? It's insane that we ever left that system. May we all work towards it again.
<br><br>
Yes! The music was a wonderful addition to Demain! I remember that when I first watched Demain last quarter that was the main thing that stuck with me.

I agree the permaculture aspect of this film was attention grabbing because doing physical labor was much more effective than massively producing agriculture through technology. It also focuses on discussing how France stockholders are interrelated to the environmental efforts shown in this film. The second half of the film transitions on the particular governmental system of currency and the United States democracy. The film focuses on multiple international news such as Iceland's director is shown to resign with the protest with the people and India being the largest democracy. Overall, the film in the first part focuses on natural food sources and the necessity to reduce the amount of meat consumed then goes to talk about social power in  multiple countries. This video had a biased but refreshing perspective on the environment and government. The fact that the film covers impacts on a local basis was inspiring because it is some changes we could think about incorporating to our society as well and the things we could do on a personal level to actively participate in helping the environment.

<br><hr>
I think this film mentioned many interesting solutions to climate change, many of which you listed out in your comment. The one I found most interesting was the one you mentioned first, the idea of a local currency. Before taking this class, I never even thought that reshaping the economy could be part of the solution of climate change. Not only that, things like local currency could fix weaker economies and strengthen the community. I found that to be very powerful and very inspiring. Local currency makes it so that it is harder to take advantage of unfair systems such as fast fashion and the huge meat industry. Instead, local currency encourages purchasing from local sources, your neighbors. 
 <br><br>
I also love how, as you mentioned, this film encourages personal growth and self awareness. Watching this film made me feel as if I had the power to make changes that would impact the world. It emphasized the importance of personal action, and I think that is a really important thing to do because it is all of our collective personal actions that will create a change. If people think that their personal actions won’t create an impact, they will never take the effort to make a change and change will never be achieved. Thus, it is important that we emphasize the importance of personal action and how it can make a big difference in the world. 
 <br><br>
I was also a big fan of the music in this film. It really made an emotional impact and made me feel very involved. The music related very well to the topics that were being talked about and was overall a very nice touch to the film.

<br><hr>
I also loved this film! Unlike most films about the climate crisis, it was very uplifting and focused on the solutions that are already being implemented on a community and city level. The idea of local currency is something I’ve been thinking about a lot as a very powerful potential solution for countering the profit-driven capitalist economy that draws capital outward to powerful transnational corporations, to the detriment of the local economy. Having a local currency encourages people to keep their money circulating within their communities, rather than enriching the corporations who have no interest in the wellbeing of the community members. If local municipalities can successfully enforce local currencies to prioritize local businesses and disincentivize corporate interests, we may have a shot at empowering communities from the ground up. In the United States, the feasibility of local currencies is very limited, due to the amount of collusion between large corporations and government, which results in policies that make it more-or-less illegal to tax corporate profits. If local governments could successfully pass legislation that allows them to subsidize local spending while taxing corporate spending, we could begin to build up the autonomy and resilience of communities.

I completely agree with you that this was one of the best films we’ve watched so far in this class. The inspiring narrative satisfied my craving for a positive outlook on what our future might look like if we successfully curb the climate crisis. The film presents solutions in a way that they are entirely attainable, inspiring, and motivating. Through simple, local adjustments such as small-scale and urban farming, keeping out local economies strong, properly dealing with our waste and redefining with consumer culture we can reduce carbon emissions while also revolutionizing societal values and practices to be more sustainable and wholesome. I, too, took note of how the film illustrates the importance of self-reliance, for example by growing your own food, or creating your own power. Moving forward into our unpredictable future, it is absolutely essential that we learn to take care of our own needs right from our backyard. I think that getting to that level of independence would be utterly enlightening and powerful.

This was a very interesting documentary. I think it is very important that there are families out there that are very passionate about mitigating the climate crisis and making as big of changes as Peter Kalamas’ family. I think their actions and lifestyle sets a very important example for others to follow. With that being said, I do not know if living as sustainably as the Kalamas family is very realistic for many families. The most prominent example of this is their vegetable oil powered car. Not only do many people not have the insight or resources to transform their car this manner, many families want to have a reliable car that will always get them to where they want to go. Peter Kalamas noted multiple times in the film that he was always wary if the car was going to make it to their desired destination.
  <br><br>

Another aspect of this documentary that really resonated with me was the segment on food waste. I think it is crazy that he is able to find so much edible produce and foods from dumpsters outside grocery stores and restaurants. That really made me question where all of our food waste is going. Our dining halls produce massive amounts of food daily, and there are large amounts of it that do not get eaten. I would like to think that we have sustainable practices for that food, but I truly do not know what happens to it. I think one of the main problems that leads to excessive food waste is the laws surrounding food. These laws are put into place to protect us from harmful food, but they often mean that lots of food is discarded. Food past the sell by date has to be tossed from grocery stores every day. This accounts to large quantities of food that is perfectly fine to eat. Another aspect of food waste that disturbs me so much is the amount of fresh produce that is thrown away because it is not aesthetically pleasing to the consumer. Fruits and vegetables that are naturally grown always contain small imperfections that do not affect the quality of the food. We have relied on genetically engineered crops and technology so extensively that we now expect every piece of produce to be flawless and will not purchase anything else. I am not an expert on gardening or food production, but I would imagine that there are countless pieces of produce that come out with minor imperfections and are forced to be tossed out. That is an incredible waste of fresh food we should be consuming.

I definitely agree! Food waste is a big issue in practicing sustainability. I've heard a lot of theories that the "sell by" dates in grocery stores are only so products will be thrown out, and consumers will have to pay for them again, lest they get some sort of food poisoning. Admittedly, I don't know if this is true or not, but it makes a lot of sense to me. I know consumer culture is active, even in grocery stores, which is crazy to me. I cannot imagine how much perfectly good food is discarded every day, while millions of people starve. That being said, I really like the freegan movement, but I am a little confused about the logistics. If people are able to access the food that is being thrown out for free, wouldn't that make ordinary consumers mad? I mean, if they're getting the same product for cheaper..? And how is this stuff attained? Through dumpster diving? Is that sanitary and safe to eat? 

  <br><br>

I have seen different tactics to try and alleviate food waste in grocery stores before, like the "ugly fruits", that are a little mishappen, and sold at a reduced price. Can we do something like that with the "expired" food? I've also seen people coordinate with local hotels/restaurants to get some of their leftover food, which I think is nice! Maybe there could be/is an app for that, because I would be actually really interested to see how that works/how much it costs. And that way you know there are not any flies living in your food. 
  <br><br>


I did really like that the people in the documentary that followed sustainable practices seemed very sweet and willing to help others. Especially with events like the one shown, where they will fix a broken item for you. I thought that was so sweet! It definitely goes to show that there are more ways to be sustainable than one and that many people are behind this movement. I liked the closeness of their community as well, and because it is a theme so widely seen in sustainable living, I can't help but wonder if sustainable living can bring us closer together and be happier. I hope so :)

The film “Being the Change” was an interesting and engaging experience. I came into the film not knowing what to expect except for the fact that the filmmaker was going to attempt to teach me how I can be a change to mitigate the climate crisis. I expected the usual strategies that Ken has taught throughout the course such as wasting less food, using bikes as a mode of transportation, and switching to solar and other renewable energy sources. I never expected to learn about so many different things an individual can do in their communities to make an impact on oneself and others. The first example that really peaked my interest was meditation. I thought it was really cool how Peter was able to achieve happiness through meditation and he really did seem to be living a happier life. In order to have a clear and happy mind to proceed with the transition from a CO2 filled life to reducing only 2 metric tons can have mental impacts that I never considered. I believe that having a clear mind and being able to feel more connected with the people around us through meditation is an important factor and method to consider. The Casa de Paz was also interesting because it was real-life evidence that communities can get together and work towards lowering the carbon footprint of everyone. The funniest example was Peter’s car that ran on vegetable oil and I found the car’s name, Maeby, particularly clever. A surprising example was the humanure example where Peter was using an outdoor compost toilet for the household. I think the most impressive part of this documentary is that Peter is able to live in the suburbs while also reducing his emissions down to 1/10 of the average American. Throughout the course, I have learned that the migration to the suburbs has been one of the worst cultural changes for the climate. Now, Peter is showing us that despite the growth of suburbs, it is still possible for everyone in the community to achieve what he has done. Even if we do get close to the lifestyle of Peter, it is not as drastic as I thought it would be and it seems like he is living a happier life. Even more impressive is that he is able to raise two kids! The repair cafe was also a good example of how a community can influence each other and be an example of change to get people involved. Engineers offered their services to fix broken things that people in the community own is genius because it reduces landfills and gets everyone connected. Finally, I thought the human waste fiasco was an eye-opening visual of just how much food is wasted every day. It almost makes me want to go dumpster diving near a local supermarket just to see what I can find!

I completely agree. I have always thought of meditation as something that people think work, but really doesn't. After seeing this video and hearing that Ken does it too, I am intrigued and want to start taking it seriously. The people shown to meditate seem to be living happier lives. I also really appreciated the idea that whole communities get together and as a whole try and lower their carbon footprint. I think this would encourage more people to be environmentally conscious than if everyone was doing it on their own. 
  <br><br>

Also, if cars can be made to run on vegetable oil, why do we not hear about this more? Why is this idea not pushed as much as moving to an electric car or taking the bus? To me, the car that ran on vegetable oil seemed genius, and I would like to know more about it. An idea that I do not think I will implement, though, is the use of "humanure." I feel that there are many other ways to help curb the climate crisis than doing this. However, I am still very inspired by Peter that he was able to reduce his emissions to 1/10th of the average American. 
  <br><br>

This goes to show that people who live environmentally friendly lives are not suffering, but are actually much happier. This is inspiring and great to hear. It makes people feel good when they compost, fix things instead of throwing them away, and live for the good of the climate. This video portrays that this lifestyle is very achievable and brings many benefits, and I hope that it has reached a wide enough audience to make a difference. I truly think this film would inspire change by many, even though it is older than the documentaries we usually see today. Living with the environment in mind makes for a happier life, full of purpose and meaning. This is the beginning of a movement. There will be change. Hopefully, with the coming Presidential election, the right candidate will be chosen to speed up the process of saving our environment. We need to see rapid change, and I believe we will see it.

I thought the part about meditation was especially interesting at all. People think that climate change is mainly a scientific and industrial, yet they don’t consider why industries and people keep contributing to climate change. A huge part of why we buy things is not because we need them, but because we rely on material things to help us feel happy and content.
  <br><br>
Bringing up a personal story, I went through a tougher time during my Freshman year here. I would rely on online shopping to cope with the sadness that I was feeling. I found myself looking for anything to buy, even if I didn’t even really like it. However, now that I am fortunately in a good place in my life and happy (through practicing self-care, exercising, and eating healthy food), I rarely do any shopping. I don’t need that extra source of happiness anymore, and thus contributing a lot less to pollution caused by the makeup/clothing industry.
  <br><br>
This doesn’t just apply to people who use shopping as a way to cope, but in general, people will be content with simpler lives, meaning less traveling, less indulgent way of eating, and so on.

"Being the change" doesn't really feel like a film that is helpful directly to the Climate Crisis (notice how i say "directly). Its more of a film that gives an example of a person (peter) and the possibility of living a less consuming and drastically climate aware life. It's a big difference from the previous films we have been watching. Usually they are fact driven or provide some sort of argumentative purpose (like DiCaprio's film) but this one is quite different. The film is saying, "look, I can live a eco friendly life and it's quite better than i expected". It's pretty much a film of his normal life and to be honest, it looks quite better than i expected. He has a family and children and it seems like the family is happy and "normal". There's no deprivation of fulfillment like most people would assume in his type of life. I think i can see myself living that type of life (although i'd have a tiny house because i think those are cool).  There is also a lot of self help stuff in the documentary: like how Peter meditates with his friends or how he helps his community and that's also a source of therapy. This was something that surprised me. I'm not sure if that meditative type of life style is a result of his life or its because he has time to do these leisure activities. Either way, he seems happy.

Being the Change:
  <br><br>
I really enjoyed watching this film, and believe that Peter is ultimately trying to encourage and inspire individuals that we can live simple and happy lives by becoming aware of how our actions affect others. One point that Peter pointed out and I think is truly evident is that many people today are so obsessed with technology and the assumption that our technology is what is going to save us, but he explains to us that there are certain situations where technology isn’t the best option and that this myth has ultimately been driven by the burning of fossil fuels, resulting in our current trouble with global warming. Some things that we can use in turn for technology and what he shows us he uses are less tech-driven and ultimately saves him money in the end, such as installing solar panels and solar water heaters, building LED- certified homes and driving electric cars. He emphasizes that we don’t need to be rich in order to make a difference. Watching this film gave me hope and inspired me to make real changes in my life that are extremely capable of doing. I realized that even small changes can be the start that will then lead to bigger changes and that every bit of individual action is just as important as a collective action.

I totally agree with your comments regarding the use of technology and its effects on the environment. When I think about being eco-friendly and sustainable, the first things that always come to mind are solar energy and different ways that renewable energy is being used now. In my old house, we used solar panels and although it was expensive at first, my parents always said that it was good in the long run. But now after watching this film, I can see that there are other ways to dramatically reduce our own emissions and still live suburban lifestyles with a family. Peter did a really good job showing that there are alternatives to the technology that we all associate with benefiting the environment (which it does, but this isn't easy for many people who don't have the money to spend on renewable energy). I appreciated hearing the environmentalist who gave a tour of his house and the solar panels, especially when he said that during the 1970s he also didn't have a lot of money to spend on this energy, but starting small is just as important.

  <br><br>

I feel like why most Americans don't take their emissions into their own hands or try reducing their emissions is because they feel like it is either too expensive or will hurt their lifestyles. Although being sustainable can be expensive, it doesn't have to be as Peter pointed out throughout this film. It might take more work than living our normal and convenient lives, but our planet needs us to take steps to reduce our carbon emissions. By deciding to fly less (as Peter mentioned) or to grow your own food, you can make a huge change in your emissions and drastically reduce them. The statistics of Peter's emissions truly blew me away. The fact that he was able to reduce his own emissions from 20 metric tons per year to 2 metric tons per year, while living in California and raising two children, is incredible and shows that we have no excuses as to why we "can't" take similar alternatives and reduce our own emissions.

I find it ironic that most of the people I know who like carbon-neutral lifestyles are upper-middle-class, and this doesn't make sense, people of lower-income brackets should be saving more given their economic situation. So this naturally leads me to the conclusion this isn't a wealth issue as much as it is an educational issue. By cutting down on consumption one can save money for the future. but this too doesn't make sense as just because someone is poor doesn't mean they are unable to realize cutting down saves money, its because our economy is built on cheap single-use products that are extremely wasteful but also convenient and cheap. Peter and his family can make the switch to become more environmentally friendly because they can buy more durable products that will last a long time and while this is cheaper, in the long run, the initial capital investment is something most families in the U.S can't do.

This mentality of blaming the poor without looking at the society that penalizes poor people for existing is problematic and should be addressed.

I think the film "Being the Change" and Peter Kalmus's lifestyle portrayed in it really injects a lot of hope in me. If only all American families pursued this kind of minimalist lifestyle, we would have significantly reduced our carbon footprint in the United States; having said that, I'm glad to see my desired ideals for sustainable living in practical application. Although the nuances can be quite complicated in our world, and some families don't necessarily have the same options to choose from, it is certainly better to think about moving towards a more environmental-friendly lifestyle when conditions permit so. I look forward to step into the future and pursue simple happiness like this!

Tomorrow is a very positive and interesting documentary that searches and reveals how methods and individuals are creating a better future for the environment. This film also has a very unique structure as it very easily relays important messages through the use of chapters. Within these chapters the documentary touches upon the economy, energy, agriculture, education and democracy in places such as Detroit, Denmark, Normandy, Iceland, and San Francisco. When the group traveled to Copenhagen, I found it fascinating how individuals were using renewable energy sources to power the city. They also analyzed how switching from cars to bikes and other modes of transportation can really have an impact in the long run. They were also planning on switching gasoline powered cars to electric powered cars that will store solar and wind energy in the near future. The film also highlights all the techniques that individuals are using to harvest many crops in multiple areas. I found it shocking that 70-75% of what we consume comes from small farms that spray thousands of acres with chemicals that harm wildlife and change the ecosystem. This being said and recognized, it was exciting to hear how individuals are planning to make man made forests that will protect, produce and nourish upon itself. The film also included interviews with experts of these areas which gave evidence that proves that all of  these methods do have a positive impact on the environment. I also really loved how the film emphasized the importance of education. In the beginning of the film, it was terrifying to hear that part of mankind may go extinct before the end of the century. This really affected me because to be honest, I did not know exactly how the environment is being impacted, what is happening and how fast things are progressing. I only knew the basics, such as pollution, which ultimately went in one ear and out the other because the use of factories and cars is such a norm in today’s society. I truly thought to myself that I absolutely have no power and can not make a difference. I told myself that I do not have the resources or money to make a change in any way but through this class and these documentaries, I now understand that I can do many things such as changing my lifestyle. I could adjust my lifestyle by doing things such as changing the way I transport, cut down on eating meat, especially beef, and spread awareness. But, many individuals tend to be selfish and do whatever they need to benefit them and make a profit which can be hard to change. Through education and training individuals to be problem solvers, they will be able to truly grasp the true harms and dangers of climate change and be motivated to make a change. Overall this film was a very uplifting and inspirational film that can enlighten many individuals. I would highly recommend it to others.

“Being the Change” was effective at showing its subject that Climate change is real and that individuals can take charge of the impact they have on the environment as Peter suggests recycling food, energy, and time. This film was aimed at those interested in the environment  and those we are concerned with the issue not just for casual viewers. My general reaction was that this film was not that informative and extremely similar to the other videos we have watched but less entertaining. I felt like the only difference in this film was that he suggested dumpster diving and creating cars that run off of used vegetable oils from restaurants. 

  <br><br>

This film was not really very inspiring to me but rather just saying that one family is taking initiative. I think it is cool that Peter works at NASA at CalTech and he wanted to make a change after the birth of his boys. I thought the idea of the Carbon Fee and Dividend was interesting but it did not make sense to me, because the oil prices are still going to go up causing Americans more money. I think the Food Waste Fiasco is very real but it seems extreme to promote and go dumpster diving. I do not think I really learned anything from this film. It did not create an emotional response and change any of my attitudes. I do not think I would recommend this to a friend because it was not very informative.

I also didn’t think this video was incredibly informative but I did think it was inspiring. I think this was a great film for where we are in the class, because we already have gained all this knowledge about the climate crisis and what we can do. This story offered a case study of a family who has actually implemented the changes that Ken has been encouraging us to make. I think this film did a good job of showing us that living a sustainable life is very possible for the average person and that it doesn’t involve that drastic of lifestyle changes. Another thing that I found incredibly important in this video is that switching to a more sustainable lifestyle can actually increase one’s satisfaction with their life. As we grow up we are continually searching for a way to create meaning in our lives. By dedicating one’s everyday actions to the betterment of the planet, you are showing that at least part of your life’s overall meaning is inextricably connected to the earth, a very noble attribute for a person to have.


<br><hr>
I agree with your sentiments about this video having a lack of inspiration. It was definitely cool to see one family and a couple other people live with different standards than me and my family, but otherwise the film really didn't serve a purpose to me. I understand how bad wasting food is, but the thought of dumpster diving does not sound like an adequate solution to the issue of food waste. Maybe I've been lied to all of my life, but I have been told that dumpsters are disgusting and are probably full of disease. It does not sound like a safe or healthy way to eat food, especially with all the diseases like the coronavirus going around. There were some things that seemed practical to do, such as not wasting egg cartons when only one egg is cracked. However, the dumpster diving portion of the video as well as the vegetable oil car turned me off. The fact that the car "maybe works or maybe doesn't" means that the technology isn't good enough for broad use yet, but maybe that's just from my opinion because I value reliability in my car.

I thought "Being the Change" was interesting but it had some boring parts. Near the beginning they talked about meditation and I don't see its significance. It was interesting how his car can run on vegetable oil and diesel. I wonder if biofuel is as efficient as regular gas. It's interesting how he as a scientist made changes to his life instead of thinking that better technology will fix climate change. In fact, he says that technology isn't always the best solution to our problems. He says at the beginning that buying more efficient light bulbs is just one small part of living a more environmentally friendly life. He also talks about walking the middle path where you make compromises to do what you like while making sacrifices in other areas. I thought this was a good idea because it would be very hard to have zero emissions and this will tell people that you don't need to sacrifice everything to live a more sustainable life. There were some other good parts where one guy showed how much food there was being thrown away that was still good. There was the Repair Cafe where they fix things that would be normally thrown away. I really liked the idea of a Repair Cafe because it adds life to stuff and saves money because you won't have to replace things. I feel like if my shirt ripped it would be easier to just buy a new shirt  but it would be cheaper and better to just patch it up. Overall, I liked seeing how Peter made changes to his life to cut his emissions down and how he found a purpose to his life.

I really think Tomorrow a good documentary about the environmental protection. Just like the title of this documentary, I see the tomorrow, see the future of people when I watch it. It is a practical film which provides the audiences several solutions how people can improve the environment as well as not decrease their life quality.
  <br><br>
The discussion of sustainability is very interesting and useful. In the film, my favorite eco-friendly methods are the self-sufficient gardening and the reuse of garbage in the city. When the directors go to Detroit, they interview citizens there and find that people grow fruits and vegetables just beside the road or in the wasteland of urban area. At the same time, they considered about the mutual relationship among the vegetables. For example, the basil and tomatoes are grown together because basil has strong aroma which can prevent the bite of pests of tomatoes, while the tomatoes do not compete water and soil with the basil. Besides, I really like the notion mentioned in the film is that urban and countryside are not separated. If people can combine city garden with rural agriculture efficiently, people will get more harvest in the future. Another instance in the film is how workers arrange the garbage. They try their best to reuse the garbage as much as possible. Basically, they recycle the plastics and then collect the leaves and soil contain huge amount of microorganism. These micros are good to the plants, so they sell them to the farmers and ranchers to gain money, which really accomplish the sustainability. There is a sentence in the film moved me: “They are not garbage, they are resources.” I can feel their true heart that they struggle to make the Earth a better place.
  <br><br>
To sum up, Tomorrow is an optimistic documentary which provide me confidence of the planet’s future. It shows a lot of efficient and workable approaches to keep the sustainability of the environment.

In the film, Tomorrow, I noticed that although the film focuses on different major aspects of topics involving climate change, it does a good job of focusing on each as well as giving positive outlooks for the future. They not only involved the problems that are associated but they gave solutions to the issues we face today. For example one issue that they focused on that I particularly enjoyed was how large scale farming doesn’t actually do anything beneficial for the earth. They barely supply us any food only about 7% while they also deplete the soil because they don’t implement intercropping or permaculture. Small farms on the other hand supply the majority of our food especially vegetables, and they are doing it without pesticides, excessive amounts of water, and without ridiculously large amounts of land. To be even more specific, the couple in France who tested out small scale farming proved that with minimal land they could produce up to 40,000 dollars in one year with tactics mentioned above such as using permaculture. Overall I really liked the specific information they gave on food in general because it seems like such an easy fix. There was one quote I really appreciated which involved how much of our income we spend on food which is only about 12-13% but if other costs were included such as environmental, social, and public health costs, the percent would increase up to 25-30%. That is insane!!! If our food is having this big of an impact it seems like we should be doing something to fix that sooner rather than later, like moving to growing our own vegetables for example. 
    <br><br>
  Another part of this film that I think was really done well was when it focused on how our resources are limited and we only can receive so much until it eventually dies. Specifically the scene when the camera zoomed out and reveals the warehouse filled to the brim with things. We have such a materialistic world and culture which is the root of the problem in most cases. We will continue to consume until one day we run out of things to consume.

I don’t believe that technology is always the answer. I really resonated with what Peter said in the film about the ‘myth of progress.’ We need global temperatures to stop rising. Small personal changes are good but not enough to do the trick. I agree that we can achieve true happiness by living sustainably and doing the right thing, and there’s different versions of this for different types of people.I appreciate Al Gore because he urges everyday people to turn off the lights, go solar, and use a minimum amount of water. However, those changes aren’t enough. This class has inspired me to make changes such as cutting down on animal products and biking more. Is this enough? How can I actually improve my life? Peter is an amazing example of an environmental activist that has found peace in what he does. I hope to achieve an environmentally conscious lifestyle for myself someday. This film demonstrates that we don’t have to sacrifice anything major in order to do so in a positive light. There’s beauty in a simple lifestyle. Lastly, it’s one thing to make changes, but it’s also important to spread the message and lead by example.

The movie “Tomorrow” offers many alternative solutions to reduce your climate footprint and it definitely gave me a lot of hope. It takes all negative aspects of society and offers a plethora of ways for the average individual to change their lifestyle to be more sustainable. The narrators traveled around the world, presenting the watcher with many different ways different countries are attacking this problem, whether it be in Copenhagen implementing bikes and public transportation or Reunion Island building solar panel roofs for greenhouses. Another initiative that was inspiring was the one taking place in Detroit, where people have begun growing their own crops and food, by creating gardens where the community can have access to organic food. By doing so, not only do people become self sufficient, which as the woman in France said, is a great feeling and very empowering, but they also reduce transportation and greenhouse gas emissions, by cutting out the step of produce transportation and driving to the grocery store, and also completely halt the use of chemical pesticides, improving and protecting the soil and runoff that gets into rivers and oceans. 
    <br><br>

What I found most touching and what I enjoyed most about this film was the message of hope that ran through the whole movie. The narrators, as they traveled through many different parts of the world, successfully attempted to rewrite climate change from being seen as a hopeless situation to being a situation with attainable solutions. I was fascinated by the idea of having local currency so that the money made circulates through the community and eventually comes back around. I also loved that the film emphasized the importance and magnitude of educating people on the severity of the situation and how badly we need change. To many people around us, it may seem obvious, but we are such a small percentage of the demographic and population that education across the board is necessary. One amazing way France is doing this is by using inmates to farm sustainably. It gives them purpose, and allows them to learn valuable skills for future jobs they may not have gotten otherwise. Closer to the end of the movie, the narrator discusses that one of the major causes of people’s lack of willingness to act is humanity’s tendency to be selfish. This is at the root of every decision that stops people from going that one step further, and making the change necessary, simply because they may not want to. It is completely and accurate, but with slight adjustments to lifestyles, great impacts can be made, hopefully before it is too late. The main message this movie portrayed throughout is that people can and need to work together in order to create a better tomorrow.

I really agree that this film sparked a lot of hope. All quarter, Ken has bombarded us with an alarming tone about how the climate is deteriorating and doing so at a rate that can make it hard to overcome it. It was actually very nice and comforting seeing all the changes going on around the world to help the climate crisis. To be completely honest, I personally had no hopes for climate change on a personal level as I thought it was essentially hopeless unless the government stepped in and actually began to drop the hammer on the issue. However, I really agree with you that this film’s underlying hopeful tone, as well as showing many examples of change already happening certainly boosted my hopes to see a better future.

I enjoyed this film "Being the Change" and seeing how this family was perfectly content with what they had. It showed how you don't need a big house and a nice car to be happy. Since having a big house and a nice luxurious car is the dream for most, we need to change our dreams to better fit environment. If we were to all pursue and obtain these dreams our carbon emissions would further increase to dangerous levels. The family in this movie was active and resourceful as they would bike to school instead of taking a car and releasing carbon emissions, and when they would use a car it was a car that was powered off of used vegetable oil that he would go get from restaurants. It was inspiring to see how this family significantly reduced their carbon footprint while still living a life that they enjoy.
    <br><br>
I also found it interesting that we are in this problem because of our desire to have more. Every time that we throw something away, we don't really throw it away, it merely gets moved somewhere else. Commercials and social media convince us that if we have the newest clothes and products that we will be happier, however this film went to show how that is not true at all and that one can be content with what they have. We don't need to release excessive amounts of carbon emissions on clothes, cars, and large homes because we can all be happy with a lot less than that.

I agree with your view of the documentary. For one, I was very jealous of that amazing avocado tree his home has; it also made me realize how it helped them grow their food when their land was already very fertile. Their life appears to be very calm and peaceful that it made me feel a little more relaxed watching their family perform their daily routines. In the beginning, I was a little confused as to who this man was and why he was giving us a “week in his life” video. Until I realized how the beginning of his story relates to many people who hear about climate change once and then do not think about it again for many years. It was amazing to see that Peter and his family were living a sustainable lifestyle and he even had 1/10 greenhouse emissions compared to those of the average American. His graph helped get the point across of how much change his family went to decrease their carbon emissions from 2010 to 2014. They did this successfully by giving up flying, biking and growing their food. Pancho Ramos showed how he serves his community and the way they pick fruits and vegetables to give to the neighborhood. I was surprised to learn that all these people embracing this lifestyle had a Ph.D. in respected fields. When they explained the individual effects on the planet, it gave me hope that the changes I am already implementing are making a difference. I agree with you, watching the way all these people were living was inspiring and gave me hope. Culture change may be needed to change the mindset people have where they think they need to have all of the newest clothes or cars and the biggest homes.

The film, “Being the Change”, centered on the need to take immediate action in order to secure a habitable place for the young generation as well as the generations that are to come. This is a recurring theme in many of the films we have watched so far, but the film is distinct in its own way. It discusses the climate crisis on a personal level. It showcases a father who is worried about the lives his two sons will experience during their life and in order to shell his offspring from the magnitude of the crisis, he employs rapid change in his professional and personal life. He changes from his previous profession to become an environmentalist, searching for solutions to the global issue of climate change. He then takes the initiative to live a low greenhouse emission lifestyle by converting a traditional vehicle into a vegetable fuel car, riding bicycles, minimizing waste, composting, and more. In all, the film depicted a simple and conscious way of living that lead to be believe that the purpose of the film was to educate the public about the climate crisis by highlighting society’s devastating new habits thereby promoting the idea of returning to an old way of life, a more simple and less stressful, where we would return to the Earth. However, by the end of the film clarifies that they are not invoking a “primitive living” but rather proposing solutions each individual in society could take part on to minimize the natural greenhouse emissions being emitted annually. In my opinion, and although there is a community of individuals who are implementing these techniques into their lifestyles it is ridiculous to believe that every individual in society will also make the necessary changes as the minority already have. In order for society to take action, the government must enforce new living regulations in order for the entire nation to the committee the cause. Otherwise, there will be a trend that a small percentage of the population is contributing to the solution whereas the majority continue to live the “normal” lifestyle filled with waste and physical materials. The unfortunate aspect of all of this is that even though some people are being the change, their efforts are being counterproductive due to the continuous greenhouse emission of everyone who refuses to take part.

I really like your take on the film, and you offered me a much better perspective on it than I had had before. When I first watched it I felt kind of confused, as it just felt like the film was all over the place when it transitioned from different subjects and aspects of Peter’s life. But seeing more from his perspective of a father who knows he is able to make changes in his life that will at least on some small level positively impact his children’s lives and his community, made the message much clearer. It was refreshing to see someone such as Peter have a huge background in physics, yet still know he can do something about the environmental challenges we are facing. While I don’t know if I myself could live in the way he does, I at least know it is possible, and there are those out there that care enough to take that level of action. I do agree that it is unrealistic to expect everyone, even the majority of people to act in this way. We do need sweeping political change throughout our country to make a difference and make it quick. That paired with a shift in the way society acts towards the environment would be substantial in regards to mitigating climate change.


<br><hr>
Yes, I completely agree with your thought regarding the need for a government related policy to actually make a drastic change. The majority of the people are still living the normal consumerism life where they think owning more things equals to success and happiness, and it is understandable that this ideology could not be erased from the public as it has been circling around the world for centuries. As we all know, the government and the businesspeople have all gained a lot from the promotion of consumerism, and it is expected that they would not stop. Therefore, even if many are attempting to take action to have a simpler life, it is certainly not enough. We need to aim at the governing policies which promote the mass consumption and mass waste of products to ultimately change the fundamentals of social ideologies.

It's similar to the documentary we saw before. It's all about the climate crisis. But this documentary highlights more about what individuals should do for the climate crisis. Peter Kalmus uses his own biological experience to show us how to reduce our carbon footprint. Before he changed, his carbon footprint was 20 metric tons, which is the average level of the United States. After the change, his carbon footprint was one-tenth of that before. When I heard this message, I thought of the situation that a person could reduce so many greenhouse gas emissions and continue to meet the needs of his daily life. I'm very upset to think about our excessive consumption and waste before. And some actions to reduce carbon emissions can also help us exercise our body and spirit. As an ordinary person, I can't do this. I can only contribute to the climate crisis in my own way.

For the past 8 weeks, we have been learning about the damage that we humans have been doing to the Earth and the things that we must do to save our planet. However, the things that we have been told to do seem very hard to implement into our own daily lives. However, this film showed us an example of someone proving that it is indeed possible to live a sustainable lifestyle and cut our carbon emissions to 1/10th of what it is. This film was very inspiring to me because he lives where I live so I can not use “but it is impossible to live like him in Los Angeles.” This film taught me that I have no excuses to become a better tenant on Earth.


<br><hr>
I've gone back and forth throughout the duration of this class between the idea that whether or not every single small change we make will make a big impact and the other idea that our small changes won't amount to the amount of damage large corporations are doing to our environment--drastic changes only matter at this point. Watching how Peter decreased his carbon footprint to 1/10ths of his original amount was honestly amazing--especially with him living in Los Angeles. It made me change my mind again, if everyone could reduce their carbon footprint by 1/10th I'm sure that would make a positively enormous impact on our environment. On the other hand, I do think changing up one's everyday lifestyle will be hard, especially when people don't see the direct harm they cause immediately. But for the greater good of our planet, I hope that people will be able to come forth with an open mind and learn to discipline themselves so that we can all implement environmentally friendly choices into our lifestyle and overall impact our environment in a positive way.

By looking at Peter Kalmus’ life and his efforts to deal with climate change and carbon footprints, I feel really inspired and motivated. It is a good example for people to follow. I can feel how happy they live and how effective and efficient their life is. Magically, when Kalmus’ friend who lives in a community and cultivates plants by himself smiles and laughs, I also smile and feel happy. After that, I really yearn for that kind of life and I want to make my own efforts to help mitigate the issue of the climate crisis and contribute more. Finally, I hope that our generation, specifically our classmates, also feel inspired after watching this documentary and start our changes, our profoundly influential changes toward the planet.

It was so nice to watch a movie like "Being the Change" because it exhibited how simple lifestyle changes can make a massive difference in your carbon footprint. It was slightly alarming that me and my family don't really live like this, because this is ideally how every single American should be living.  The amount of waste that they emit is something that is the maximum per household as Ken mentioned in this video. I think that certain changes, such as planting your own food and even self improvement practices like doing yoga help relax the mind and body. I remember when my mom started to plant her own tomatoes and lemons, it was such a proud moment for her to use them in her cooking. It also made it so that she didn't have to take trips to the grocery store or worry about where her produce was coming from because it was growing right in front of her eyes. I think that my best friend and I have this conversation all the time, of being obsessed about being busy. Students pride themselves on being booked back to back, not coming home till late in the day because they were too busy working, studying, exercising or being social, but I think that living like Peter did is the best way to go about life. He truly did seem calm and collected and fulfilled by the life he was living because everything was within a balance, and that's something that a lot of Americans are going to have to start wrapping their heads around in order to actually work towards a better tomorrow. These principles aren't new to humanity, and it's very clear that they're being practiced in places primarily in Europe, but Ken is right. We should be the change we wish to see, and by one person acting like this, so many more will follow suit.

Something I really appreciated about your comment was the example you provided of how your mom began to grow her own tomatoes and lemons because it is something that is really doable for a lot of people. While starting with just a couple plants may not be on the level of Kalmus’ garden it is such a great step in the right direction. A lot of people do not have a backyard like Kalmus where they can plant beds of produce and build their own outdoor bathroom, but even people in apartments could put a small plant in their window as a start. Another option that Ken has mentioned before would be to look into finding a community garden where you can purchase your own section or could even share it with friends. This also relates back to the part of the film where Pancho Ramos-Stierle takes the fruit that he grows at casa de paz and gives it out to the community expecting nothing in return. If more of us were able to start small gardens that produce enough to share with our friends and family then, as you mentioned, we would have less need to go to the grocery store. Grocery stores cause a huge amount of emissions from the waste they produce as well as from the transportation that is required to supply them with their produce so growing our own food when possible is an incredible alternative. 

    <br><br>

Another thing that really drew me to your comment was how you brought up the idea that students glorify being constantly busy. As mentioned in the video “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy,” when people work less they tend to live not only happier lives, but lives with less emissions, lives with less consumption, and lives with more innovation. When we are constantly overworking ourselves with school and work we do not allow ourselves time to take a step back and evaluate how we are living our lives in terms of how much CO2 or equivalent gases we are producing. Kalmus demonstrated how his meditation practice allows him to limit his climate anxiety which then allows him to be more present in his everyday life, where he is able to make more conscious decisions. Kalmus obviously has a very strong sense of innovation, which can be seen both through his job at JPL as well as through his creation of Maeby, the grease powered car. While it can be tough to take a step back from the constantly reinforced idea that college students should work until they have achieved success (money) or until they overwork themselves, if we want to see a better future we really need to restructure our society’s values. 

    <br><br>

As you mentioned in your comment, it is alarming that more families are not living like the Kalmus family. I think that a couple of reasons that there are not more families practicing this green lifestyle is due to lack of information and a lack of accessibility. While Kalmus mentions that he knows people, in particular Ed Begley Jr., who have spent even more money than him to build a sustainable house, to many people Kalmus is the one with more money. While everyone that has the ability to invest some money in converting to a greener life, for some people it is much less of an option because they are just making enough money to survive. Produce tends to come at a higher price than processed, and therefore packaged, products so it is much more difficult for low income people to feed their families with sustainability in mind. The other issue, which is more easily solved, is people being unaware of what they can do to make changes. Starting with classes like this one, we can spread the message of what can be done to limit our personal emissions starting with our homes and our transportation. While nothing can truly be changed on a large scale if we do not make social and political changes, we can all just try our best to do our part.

Being the Change:    <br><br>

Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution overall was a good movie. Climate scientist Peter Kalmus does a good job on showing how to deal with environment issues in a personal way. I like how Kalmus does not care if no one else is trying to save the planet and is trying to take action in his own way. Kalmus sets a great example for his audience. For instance, to address carbon footprint, he encourages and personally does choose to not travel by plane and to bike everywhere. Kalmus also gave a different perspective on how to go about climate activism. Kalmus encourages everyone to meditate on these ideas and address these issues with your head, hands, and heart. You must understand the situation, then take action, and encourage yourself to continue this process. 
    <br><br>


I always assumed that it would be hard to be environmentally conscious with a family, but Kalmus shows that you can raise a family in an environmentally friendly way. I liked seeing the Kalmus’s family having an outdoor composting toilet and a car named “Maeby” that runs on waste vegetable oil. I also liked how Kalmus was one of the more realistic environmentalists. He made many sacrifices to be more environmentally friendly such as having 2 kids instead of the 3 he initially wanted but he still does things that are very harmful such as owning a car. To combat him owning a car, he tries to make it as environmentally friendly as possible. I was very alarmed to hear how we produce enough food to feed two entire American populations, while 50 million Americans are food insecure.  I will be more mindful for the future generations.

I agree! I think a lot of people assume that its pretty difficult to be environmentally friendly and have a bigger family or a family in general. It'a so great that they can give us examples of raising a family in a more conscious way and display that it is so possoble! For me it honestly is suoer encouraging and extremely valuable that there are people who follow this amazing lifestyle and are also so incredibly happy.

In this video, the most important and core character is a climate activist, Peter Kalmus. Also, he showed us his lifestyle and how he effectively decrease his own carbon footprint with his family. Besides, other than lower down carbon footprint, he also found his own happiness throughout this process. He introduced three parts of his concept of head, hands, and heart. The "head" part means that you have a comprehension about the climate change and how severe this problem is. The "heart" part is dealing with finding the true meaning and what we have to do. In other words, if we want real changes, we have to do things truly from our deepest heart. We cannot make changes that because we have to do. It needs great number of happiness and passion. 
    <br><br>

I believed he has motivated tons of people to take action to reduce their own personal carbon footprint. It is not only for ourselves but also for our society.

It is refreshing to see a family living an environmentally conscious lifestyle without showing that they have given up anything or made a major sacrifice. I love how Peter talks about his car,  and how he can flip the switch with excitement like a kid to change the source of fuel. It's great to see a movie about making a difference for our environment and presenting the information in an optimistic way. As more emotional thinkers, many of the documentaries I've seen have made me more frustrated with our environmental conditions than driven by change. However, this film enables me to envision my future, and I hope this will include building my own family and understanding how to live a sustainable lifestyle and raise my children to do the same. I like how Peter explained his desire to become a future change maker to raise children, rather than choosing to increase the number of children to avoid them. Although his lifestyle is not necessarily minimalist, as we have seen in previous lectures, I think this is definitely a simpler lifestyle, which is shown from a positive perspective. As Peter notes, is to not only be the change, but make that known. This is where personal action can easily and organically grow, when the climate conscious person actively shares their lifestyle in their community, and uses it to support others. That is exactly where the 'House of Peace' comes in.

As many previous comments have already mentioned, I strongly believe that this a great alternative perspective being displayed to the audience. This can be seen in the movie through the emphasis on the difference between individualists and collectivists. On one hand, it can be seen that Kalmus and family are an example of an individualistic contribution to becoming more environmentally-friendly but at the same time, the family collectively came together as a group to alter their lifestyles for the greater good. Furthermore, in my opinion, by displaying the two perspectives in terms of initiating change, it gives viewers more of a choice and more resolutions to prompt change. In terms of the film, collectivist change can be noticed with the non-profit environmental organizations shown, such as the Sierra Club. The film shines a good light on the essence of collectivism as a message I found with mass movements is that with a large number of people, it becomes easier to gain larger attention and thus, prompt more people to join the movement. Beyond that, I am a firm believer that solutions to the climate crisis can be achieved from both a collectivist and individualist standpoint. Individual efforts are beneficial as it provides people with a greater sense of satisfaction and can further be seen as an example to others who are afraid to alter their lifestyle. To conclude, I strongly believe both a collectivist movement and individualistic movement are necessary to prompt further climate change.

In this week's film, I think Peter's situation represents that of many people in our society when it comes to climate change. Many of us have slowly come to agree on the fact that climate change is in fact happening. However, many people differ from Peter in that they are not as willing to change. Peter realized the impact his carbon footprint has on the planet and took steps to avoid the negative consequences of his actions. If more people were as willing as Peter was to act now, we might have a good chance at saving our planet.

Would it be possibly for a family to live a substantiable life in the US/ California? Of course. However, it depends on what type of lifestyle one desires. A rural, locally produced goods society would most likely result in smaller carbon footprint. However, urban and suburban living is often desired. The issue is America’s infrastructure supports vehicle transportation and outsourced goods. So, to live an urban lifestyle in a substantiable matter is much more difficult. Once, carbon taxing begins, green transportation options will need to be built to replace highways and interstates to encourage more substantiable forms of transportation. Foods and commodities then should be locally grown and exchanged. These major changes could make urban living more substantiable than ever before but we need the government to pave the way.

At first, the documentary "Being the Change" made no sense to me at all. I was waiting for the main subject, Peter Kalmus, to tell me what to do, how to start “being the change” but he kept talking about meditation, and music, and the avocado tree in his backyard. I didn’t understand… where’s all the environmental stuff?? And then it hit me. Sure, this man made some pretty big changes to his lifestyle in order to reduce his carbon footprint (to about 1/10th of that on the average American!) but that wasn’t what he was trying to teach through this film. The purpose was to show that this man and family live a full, and in fact quite beautiful, life - not despite making those changes, but because of them. This conscious, mindful, and simple lifestyle seems to have added so much to his life - from the peaceful bike ride to work, hobbies like working on the car and volunteering in the Repair Cafe, connecting with family through their shared values and daily practices, and the most beautiful of all in my opinion - Peter has been connected to so many vibrant, smart, innovative, nurturing and interconnecting communities that share his interests and values. This film absolutely inspired me and encouraged me to think about change in a new way, a way that adds to life rather than takes away.

I agree with you. I also think that the changes that Peter brought into his and his family’s life definitely positively affected them. I have always thought that such culture that we have right now, and which has been the standard of living for many years, is not how humans used to live. The film shows us different places in which people are living together, serving each other, and I think it is beautiful. So many generations of our ancestors have lived close together, doing the exact same thing other people in this film do, and suddenly they had to change their lives completely because of the new standards imposed on them by their governments and various companies. People simply are not adapted to the lifestyle that modern economic systems require us to have. But, thanks to the videos like that, many can see that the life doesn’t have to be what most of us imagine it to be. You can be happy with an avocado tree and a shower outside your house, as Peter proves. 
    <br><br>
Overall, I thought it was a good film. It demonstrated various techniques to living a good life and being happy, and I think this is very important in today’s world. If we cannot love our life and be happy, we can’t give it back to the people around us, and especially our planet.

Not a beginning, but a rise. The concept of simplifying one’s life and rejecting the societal trap of materialism has been around for centuries, this we learned from the readings by Henry David Thoreau. The film, Being the Change, examines different lifestyles that all idealize sustainable living. From the family of four to the meditation camp, the film accurately displays the truth that living an eco-friendly life isn’t just one mold. With enough creativity and flexibility, anyone can move to lower their personal greenhouse emissions. 
    <br><br>
The idea that everyone can live an incredibly sustainable life right now is possible, but it’s just not realistic. Certain aspects of living simple mandate the use of carbon emissions; examples include the medical industry, military, and lower class communities. Our world is full of much diversity, to expect everyone to be able to quit the fossil fuel addiction is just plain naive. But before you can even find a way to accommodate everyone’s lifestyles, you first have to overcome the deeply engraved connections of success and happiness with materialism, consumerism, and therefore carbon emissions. This mindset that more and bigger means good is almost biological; to shift this concept away from fossil fuels is a task greater than any eco-friendly innovation we can come to develop. 
    <br><br>
Still, we don’t need the entire human population to join the cause in order to make a difference. The more people hop on this movement, the more innovations accommodating largely sustainable living. For the sake of saving our planet, this movement and all it encompasses will need to grow at an exponential rate. Only time will tell if what we’ve done and are planning to do is enough.

I do not think this is the beginning of a new era for a way of life. I think this style of living is very niche and only a small percent of people could or would willingly do this. I know I personally have no interest in living like Peter and his family do. If people want to live like that, good for them! I think the belief that this will be the new normal is a bit too optimistic. While I did not particularly enjoy this film, it did make me think about some new aspects of environmentalism I had not put much thought into before. 
    <br><br>


When talking about composting, one person said " “when you throw your trash away, you’re not throwing it away, there is no such thing as away, it is planet earth”. That made me think about just the phrase itself of throwing something away. We are literally just throwing it away from ourselves, but ultimately it ends up on the floor, just somewhere we do not see. I also thought the idea of a play about one of the founding members of environmentalism was a new and probably effective method to get people to be more aware of their carbon footprint in an interesting and engaging way, instead of just hearing about the data and more "boring" parts of it through articles or videos. 
    <br><br>


When discussing the one man show, one person made a quick witted joke about how we hve nothing to worry about because Trump said it is all just a hoax. I found that really funny, but also has a deeper underlying message to it. People make light of scary situations to help themselves and others get through it. I appreciated his joke and like that even though it is a scary time, these people are doing all they can to make a difference.

There is definitely something to be said for the intrinsic value one can gain from living a simplistic and more “regenerative” lifestyle. I was impressed by each subject in the film and how holistically Peter has been able to shift his habits while also living a reasonably “normal” middle-class American lifestyle. At the end of the day I think that he can serve as a role model to some extent for people who are looking to make lifestyle changes for the sake of the environment. With all of that being said, for someone like “Uncle Pete” who we discussed in the context of the reading, I do not think this film is an effective method of inspiring lifestyle change. I think that much of Peter’s behavior and that of his family would be perceived as far too extreme for those who are not already looking to make significant changes. Modifying your car to run on vegetable oil you have to collect from restaurants or especially basing how many children to have on the environmental implications, while admirable, does not seem like a realistic spread of solutions for people who aren’t ready. That’s not to say that the film wasn’t interesting and potentially impactful for a lot of people, but I think that it falls into the already large collection of messaging tools that do not reach the people who need it the most.

I feel like "Being the Change" was a film that opened the eyes of many because it was so refreshing to see and follow Peter around his healthy lifestyle. Props to Peter for being able to devote his life to following strict rules and routines. It's truly inspiring to see how he was able to lower his CO2 emission to such a reduced level. Seeing Peter and his life put me in an extremely reflective mood. This week's film really made me reflect on topics we've covered before in class. Particularly the importance of sustainability and how important it is to fundamentally change the way we live. Whether it be changing your diet, public transportation, bike transportation, minimizing your belongings, eliminating unnecessary lifestyle aspects--one step at a time can make a huge difference no matter how small the step.

I agree, it was super cool to see the ways that Peter has devoted his life to sustainability. I think sometimes people can be intimidated by films like this because his lifestyle may seem extreme to others, so they say “oh, well I could never live like that”. While it may not be feasible for everyone to make such extreme changes, I think it is important to reflect on our own lifestyle choices and start to see where small changes can be made. Like you, and Ken, have said, things like diet and transportation can be changed in relatively small ways that will have positive consequences. Even if we can’t completely dedicate our lives to living sustainably, we can take inspiration from people like Peter and make changes where we can.

<p>
In watching the film “Being The Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution,” first and foremost, I was truly impressed with the way in which Peter chose to live. It’s one thing to attempt to reduce your carbon emissions and better the planet by making certain lifestyle changes, but altering almost every part of your daily life seems almost impossible, yet he has done so. Watching this actually occur in people’s lives is pretty astonishing because given the way I currently live, it seems like quite a far stretch. 
    <br><br>
Although I have a great deal of respect for this major effort, what I didn’t particularly agree with, however, was Peter’s take on technology. While he didn’t attempt to undermine other people’s take on the use of technology as a beneficial way to aid in the climate change efforts, he felt that the reduction of technology use and advancement was a better use of time. I personally feel that the advancement of technology, although possibly expensive, is the best way to reduce carbon emissions and possibly even invent new ways to save the planet. Without the advancement of technology like solar panels and other renewable energy sources, our primary source of energy would be fossil fuels. Given that most people cannot or will not live in the way Peter does, fossil fuels will continue to be burned at an alarming rate. Thus, it seems that the best option for this  issue is to continue and support the advancement of technologies like these until they become affordable and commonplace.

I too was completely shocked and impressed by the things Peter does every day to help the environment. It makes me really think about what the true results would be if everyone--or even just the majority of the earth decided to live in a way closer to Peter. Now, I don't see that ever actually happening, but the thought of it is wild. Peter's actions made me see the way I live as even more destructive than i thought before. 
    <br><br>
In regards to his thought on technology, Im going to have to agree with you on this one. Technology is one of the only ways to get sustainable energy, and to track the fluctuations in the earth's climate. We also must take into consideration how Peter's economic situation, where he lives, and overall privilege  allows him to live in the way he does. Not everyone could manage this for an endless amount of reasons, but he is inspiring nonetheless.

This week's film, Being the Change was very interesting and inspiring. Rather than presenting statistics of climate change, we are able to see how people are living sustainable lives. This film is able to provide solutions to the climate crisis and can encourage many of us to do the same. Peter showed it is not only important to change our actions as individuals but also act as a whole. He showed he was able to change some of his everyday habits such as growing his own food, driving a car on vegetable oil, commute by bike, and installed an outdoor bathroom that could be used as compost. Peter mentioned that his actions feel like a drop of water in a bucket but I believe the more people start to change their habits, these drops will accumulate over time and help make a difference. 
    <br><br>

One aspect of the film I really liked was when they had engineers and seamstresses fix products and clothing items that people had without purpose at home. It was great to see a community coming together in order to help make a difference for our planet. The point of this program is to help reduce the amount of waste that gets put into our landfills. Someone is able to bring something they have that no longer works and are able to get it fixed or repurposed. I loved that idea and I think we should try to implement something like that on our campus if we don’t have something like this already. 
    <br><br>

The amount of food waste shown in the film was not surprising based on what we have seen and read previously in this class. What I thought was a good idea was the need to spread public awareness of this issue. The man in the film was able to showcase all the perfectly good food that he had found in dumpsters by stationing in parks. I think food waste should be talked about more and people should become more educated on the issue. What the man in the film was doing should help catch the eyes of many and help lead them to realize how much of an impact their actions have on our environment. But, we all need to do our part to help spread awareness and take action. It might seem as though one person’s actions can’t help make a difference but every little bit helps and accumulates to something more.

I agree, Being the Change was an incredibly inspiring film. Peter Kalmus goes to great lengths to make a difference in his emissions, and ultimately lives a much happier and fulfilling life because of it. I found myself inclined to practice all of these methods Kalmus does, until the film hit the dumpster diving part. I understand why the man displayed all the food he found in dumpsters, but this doesn't seem practical or something I would enjoy doing. Additionally, the at Hume human waste compost is something I can never picture myself doing. These two practices seem a little radical to me, however besides that I found the rest of the film inclining. I would like to ride my bike more, practice meditating, and someday grow my own garden and compost. Peter shows how simple these actions can be and inspires his audience to do what they can.

Watching "Being the Change" made me think about how I am conditioned to be judgemental about people like Peter. He is pretty much the epitome of a hippie, which is a word with typically negative connotations. I never really thought about how "hippies" of the world are sometimes living the happiest and most environmentally sustainable lives. I grew up placing so much value on money, objects, clothes, and always buying things new that sometimes I caught myself being judgemental and hyprocritical of my own values at certain points of the movie. For example, when they showed the man who routinely goes dumpster diving eating a sandwich from the garbage, I found myself a little grossed out. But, in the end, if the food is perfectly fine, why shouldn't he be eating it? Why is it being thrown away instead of given away to people in need? Why do they have to dig through other people's trash to find something to eat? Instead of dumping all these perfectly salvagable foods, I wish more restaurants and grocery stores donated them and made it more publicly known that safe food items that cannot be sold, such as egg cartons with a single broken egg, are available.

I agree with you, that I was a bit disgusted at the thought of people dumpster diving for their food, and living, as Ken says, as “freegans”. But, when hearing about the idea of “The Food Waste Fiasco”, brought about by Rob Greenfield, it made me change my mind. Rob collects food that is expired or will otherwise be thrown away and displays it in public places to show the world how much of our good food is being wasted. With the thought of the amount of people in this world who are starving to death, and the idea that America produces enough food for two times it’s population, as we have learned in class, it made me think about how we could save this food and give it to people in America who are hungry. Like Rachel said, “I wish more restaurants and grocery stores donated them and made it more publicly known that safe food items that cannot be sold”. If restaurants and grocery stores all over America started to do this, our starvation rate could go down. If there are people in the world who need food and cannot afford it, why not give them the perfectly good food that will otherwise go to waste?


<br><hr>
I also thought at first that Peter was a little extreme and that I could not follow his lead. The more I learned about him and his daily practices, however, I realized that his life has a whole different and fulfilling meaning. He knows through his meditation and environmentally sustainable lifestyle that he is respecting the earth and using it to not leave his footprint to the extent that it harms future generations. I think his background in technology and his ability to use his scientific training to promote climate conservation is very commendable. I also think he is an example of someone who is humble with his life choices. He doesn't go out and knock on people's doors telling them to change, but communicates his desires for the community and world to follow in his footsteps, by physically making the footsteps -- he truly is the change. 
    <br><br>


Some really unique things that stood out to me with Maeby (the car, so cool!), the work he did joining the Citizen's climate lobby, and the segment on food waste fiasco. The invention of the car, keeping Peter true to his tech background, and his activism work with the citizen's climate lobby, is truly so innovative and makes me want to do the same. The Food waste fiasco is such an interesting demonstration that I think truly does make people realize that food that has bruises is still food. Lastly, I think the repair days that happened once a month in Pasadena was truly such a beautiful thing that I think we need more of. When I was little, the church next to my house would hold community events like silent auctions, bake sales, picnics, and other gatherings. In recent years, I have seen an increase in people's desire to stay within themselves and not really tap into the fact that we have a community. And this sentiment is manifested throughout the world -- people have seemed to stop caring about one another and working towards common goals. This repair day, even though small, is a revival of those very days of community building. I think Peter does a great job of showing the head, hands, and heart throughout this documentary and has inspired me to use my life to implement similar initiatives to his.

Being the change defines a new way of living in current life for me. Unlike other films that we have finished, this film focuses more on the actions and goals that we can simply complete in order to live peacefully with the planet earth. The filmmaker, also the author of the book Being the change, is Peter Kalmus who is a Ph.D. in climate scientist working for NASA. His experience and position make this film very authoritative. He is also very inspiring at cutting the carbon footprint and dedicated to the work of conveying this idea to many people around the planet. I think Peter has achieved a higher standard of moral living than most of us and this is worth learning.
    <br><br>

Peter, as a climate scientist, decides to cut his own carbon footprint to 1/10 of a typical American’s after viewing so many disastrous events caused by climate changes in the past few decades. I am surprised that he successfully did it. I learned many new ways and terms that could be helpful to alleviate our own carbon emissions from now on. There are planting food in our backyard, vegetable oil cars, more biking, fewer lights, and collect wasted food that is actually edible. I was astonished by the vegetable oil car at most. I learn about the use of vegetable oil in cars to replace gasoline cars. However, there are both positive and negative sides of that. Because of the unstable performance, and the immature technology to make vege-cars in volume production, I rarely believe that someone can make one for his daily uses and it is fun to ride a car like this and definitely healthy to the earth. 
    <br><br>

Besides this more science advanced vege-car, Peter also inspires me at calling for people to make changes in the lifestyle from now on. He actually makes good and simple advice. For example, biking more and collect wasted food. Biking would probably be the most direct and simple way to cut our carbon footprint. When there is less driving, there is less CO2 in the atmosphere. And I can simply do that. The second one is about food waste or wasted food. According to Peter, there are lots of food wasted because of over-consumption. He points out that the food we produce now is able to sustain all people on earth. But there is still hunger because some are over-consuming the food but waste most of them at the same time. This is also astonishing. I usually dump food that I don’t like but I buy no matter what or it sits there so long that I think it goes bad. The correct answer is no, and they are not going bad. If I can save some food, there is less food waste, and hence fewer landfills, and even less plastic consumption but more people feed and more happiness. 
    <br><br>

I feel more optimistic after watching Peter’s documentary. It makes me consolidate the idea of the fact of climate change, but it also encourages me to make changes right now with whatever I have. I may be sad about the disastrous events happened to many people because of climate change but I will also be hopeful because I am starting to make the change.

This movie was very inspirational and really made me consider the fact that one person changing their lifestyle can make a difference. The positive effect the changes in his life gave him was super interesting to watch, and it really made climate change seem personal. We may not be able to make some huge difference and completely reverse climate change, but our actions still have some kind of effect on the environment. The knowledge that he was actually making a change, made Peter happier and more satisfied with his life which is just another added benefit of changing to a healthier and more eco- friendly lifestyle. It’s so impressive how they lowered their emissions by a factor of 10, and how much they changed their lifestyles for this cause. Even though it was harder, they adjusted well and were gifted with immense amounts of satisfaction. 
     <br><br>
This inspired me to want to change little things in my life, to make a difference no matter how small it is. Taking shorter showers and being more conscious about conserving energy are just little things that will eventually make an impact, no matter how small it is. Spreading this to my friends also would help, and on and on. This movie made me really want to completely change my lifestyle like them, but I know it is super unrealistic so I’ll try to slowly adjust to their level. This is one of my favorite movies I’ve watched in this class.

I am able to relate about what you said regarding this documentary. It was also inspirational to me because I feel like I constantly go back and forth of whether or not me changing my own personal lifestyles is really making a difference. This way of thinking often discourages me from continuing to do these personal changes because I am a person who likes to see cause and effect relationships. What this film did for me was show me the different outcomes of being environmentally friendly that I guess I did not see the whole picture to before. Similar to you it was inspirational to watch how Peter was able to develop which at the end resulted in him being just a happier and more satisfied individual then he once was before. The fact that happiness and satisfaction is a benefit from becoming healthier and eco-friendly is motivational to me in a variety of ways. I do however understand the hardships that could come by switching your typical norms almost entirely. It is clear that in Peter’s life that the outcome of making this transition certainly out weighed the hardships which makes this idea even more appealing. Although making personal changes will not shift the pattern that climate change is currently heading towards, it clearly will not hurt. In the case for Peter not only did it not hurt him, but it is influencing many people who see his story and begin to start opening up to this idea. The same thing can be done in your own personal relationships as friends and family will begin to see your individual changes and might be willing to do them also. You never truly know how much of an impact you can have making this change, but I am sure it is one that is worth it to find out. Thank you for going in the direction you did with your comment because it made it really easy for me to reply to since I had many of the same thoughts you did!

Tomorrow (Demain) effectively puts forth the idea of addressing climate change and unsustainability with people power. The filmmakers capture the solutions being created by communities who are concerned about the loss of food and issue of overpopulation. For example, they visit Detroit. Despite mentioning its degradation, the filmmakers highlight how people have begun to grow their own crops and create gardens where the community can have access to organic food. They also visit places in the U.K. where entire cities have become self-sustaining with their own centers of crop growing and gardening. They go further by using countries like Ireland as examples of places that have let go of a reliance on fossil fuels. The film offered so many examples of self-sustaining communities that I was not aware of. It gives me a little more optimism about the future of climate change and how in the U.S., we can start following the examples set by other countries. I also liked how the filmmakers address the economics of the issue. I had no idea that cities have created their own complementary currencies that helps to put power back in the people’s hands rather than large corporations and politicians. One way we can begin to enact solutions like that in our country could be supporting local businesses. The film affirms the power of diversity and community as not just ideological, but practical solutions to a more sustainable future.

For me, the most impactful part of this documentary is when he said, “I think there’s a real connection between personal change and large scale collective change.” He is not saying that each person should do as much as him, just that a person’s actions should match up with what they say. It’s important to set and example for the rest of the world, so when deniers try to convince us life will be miserable without fossil fuels, we have tangible evidence against that. Making things trendy is such a powerful form of change - people do things without really thinking about why. Let’s make this like that.
<br><br>
I think, along with setting an example, people who enact massive personal change also do a lot for their own mental health. There’s a lot of guilt and dread that comes with the world we live in today. In this film, that distress is referred to as “Climate disorders” - fight or flight, constant anxiety about the future and the state of the ecosystem, and the government’s complete unwillingness to help. By doing whatever you can in your life, you lessen your burden.

I agree that that quote was a very impactful part of the documentary. We need to live what we believe. The quote also ties into the part of the documentary where he was talking about planes. To paraphrase: if 1 person doesn't fly, then the same amount of emissions are put into the air. However, if 300 people don't fly, that's one less plane in the air. Large scale collective change is important because it allows our collective carbon footprint to fall. This allows us to feel better about ourselves and our future because, as you said, there is a lot of guilt and dread from living in our current world because of climate change. By making these large scale changes we can help our world and our outlook on life.

I really enjoyed the documentary and your comment because in my opinion saving the planet can be summed up by this one concept: “He is not saying that each person should do as much as him, just that a person’s actions should match up with what they say.” I strongly believe that people should practice what they preach, even if they’re not making groundbreaking changes in their life, they should stick to whatever they commit to. This would make a more honest society, as well as a healthier one that would effectively address communal issues such as climate change.
    <br><br>

I also really enjoyed the part on “Climate disorders”, I have struggled with depression before and the environment I was in took a very big toll on that. I lived in a big grey city during this period of my life, and I can’t say how much being in a park or a greener area helped me feel better and more optimistic. Seeing pollution winds up being very frustrating because you start seeing society as this huge uncaring monster that’s out to destroy everything that’s good in the world.

Being the change is a movie that gives the audience a personal insight on one's life that focuses on being green. A lot of the other movies we have watched gave us facts and showed us the severity of climate change. Being the change showed us how to do something about climate change in everyday life. Peter Kalmus takes us through his journey by showing us that he gave us his job to dedicate his life more to the environment. He shows us how he moved to the suburbs and changed his whole life to be greener. He started growing food and gardening and doing his own small farming, he went into solar energy and showed us his oil powered car. Klamus works this movie in order to really cover a broad audience of people and really be as efficient as possible. He brings up points about how being green is a lot cheaper and how less really is more. I think he is able to get his message across very easily, he provides us simply with facts straight out of his life, making it hard to argue with. I personally thought his lifestyle was very interesting. It brought a lot of attention to small things I can do in my life to be more green.

Being the Change examines the life of Peter Kalmus and his family on their journey to live a sustainable, meaningful life for the sake of our planet. The core message of the documentary is that living without fossil fuels is possible and is not a life of deprivation, but a happier, more fulfilled life. This documentary was different from the others that we have watched for this class in that it was intimate and personal and did not rely on statistics and facts to evoke a response in the viewer. Peter Kalmus was able to decrease his emissions from 23 tons/year (similar to average American) in 2010 to 2 tons/year by 2014. After these four years, his emissions decreased by tenfold. He took a variety of actions to decrease his emissions, but I was surprised to learn that the decision not to fly yielded the greatest reduction in emissions. Previously, flying accounted for nearly three-quarters of his emissions. He also decided to strictly walk/bike to school and work, drive a car that ran on waste vegetable oil from local restaurants, eat food that is wasted at the supermarket level and more.

I was amazed at both the quantity and the quality of food that Americans waste. We currently produce enough food to feed two entire American populations, yet 40% of that food is wasted and as a result, 50 million Americans are food insecure. The food waste fiasco project did an amazing job of depicting the absurdity of the current food waste situation. The project collected a myriad of perfectly good food (that was thrown away by supermarkets) and laid all the food out for people to see.
    <br><br>


This documentary made me optimistic about the future. It was heartwarming to see people take action to align their lifestyle with their core beliefs and values. I was struck that the majority of these people interviewed in the documentary were all following the standard path for the American dream and then realized that their lifestyle was destructive and they felt unfulfilled. We need to realize that our cultural obsession with stuff is not making us happy and actually makes us more depressed and more anxious. Furthermore, our never-ending desire for more stuff and “phantom wealth”  is one of the leading contributors to global warming.

I have seen both of these films in the past before and have enjoyed both greatly. They both have shocking statistics throughout the films, and ways to help mitigate one's carbon footprint. In Being the Change it gave an insight to Peter Kalmus’s life. It talks about how he dropped his fossil fuel use by 10 times the average American. He bikes to work, and most places, but when Kalmus has to drive he drives his car that runs on oil they get from restaurants. This was the most interesting part of the documentary, because it was something I had never heard of. He tries to make the audience optimistic and sparks the idea that they can make a change. One does not have to get a big, fancy, expensive, environmentally friendly house, like some people that Peter interviewed within his documentary. Whereas in the film Tomorrow it talks  about how the ecosystem is being stressed to exhaustion, and it can lead to the human race becoming extinct, and life is going to be wiped out quickly if we don't do anything about this crisis. It goes into how we can switch this destruction, and creates hope in the audience. Like how Iceland wants to become fossil fuel free. Denmark has reduced their fossil fuels by 40% by 1991. They are turning coal factories into biofactories. And the city and many Copenhagers produced wind turbines to power their lives, and other countries around the world are following Denmark, like Iceland. The directors of this documentary did a really good job of educating the audience, and making them scared for the future; but they all counteracted that by creating hope in the audience, by showing what they can do to make the change and also what other countries and people are doing to make this switch.
    <br><br>

In this class we have talked about many different ways to help our climate, but Ken goes into talking about how to fast forward and reducing our greenhouse emissions to one tenth of the average Americans climate footprint. He asks could this be a good life? Personally asking for people to drop down to this extreme may be too much to ask of many people and may seem scary. But as a society we need to make this shift seem more doable and less of a big and scary change. Overall the best way to attack this problem is through education and knowledge about this climate crisis.

The film "Being the Change" was effective at communicating the ways people can reduce their carbon footprint. The narrator, Peter Kalmus, and his family adopt various lifestyle changes in order to lessen their environmental impact. Kalmus decided that he wanted to “be the change,” so he reduced his carbon footprint to nearly 1/10 of the average American by growing his own food, using vegetable oil as car fuel, biking, and more. Kalmus emphasizes not only the importance of reducing your own carbon footprint, but also the importance of educating others on ways to reduce their footprint. I also found it interesting that he would use meditation to relate better to people.
    <br><br>

The film shed light on many issues, but I thought the most intriguing issue was the amount of food wasted. Until I watched this film, I was unaware of how massive this problem was. So many Americans go hungry daily, and businesses just dump their perfectly edible food into the trash instead of donating it. Seeing the man dumpster-diving for edible food was really depressing and it opened my eyes about this problem in America.

I thought that the food aspect of this movie that was showcased was alarming also. I think that as Americans, we should do a better job of recognizing how harmful things like food waste can become if not acted upon quickly. My friend used to work at Panera, and he always said that he respected Panera Bread more than most other chains of restaurants because they donate the food that they don't sell at the end of the day. His closing shifts primarily comprised of cleaning up the restaurant and then packaging food in a manner where it could be donated to those who were less fortunate. I think that it should be slightly easier to provide food to so many people who are starving, and we truly would be striving to kill two birds with one stone: poverty and climate change.

This documentary is like a fresh stream among all other serious and solemn productions about climate change. I enjoy the time watching it and it really activates me to think about the issue of whether I could do personal things to take a small step. As a passionate scientist, Peter Kalmus choose to adopt an immediate lifestyle transformation in response to the climate crisis, rather than only using words and knowledge to warn people like other typical scientists. His “head-hands-heart” strategy for taking actions resonates with me and in fact, is the leading guide to all his following efforts. There is one thing that especially draws my attention: Peter’s car--MAEBY. This is so funny cuz the name stands for “maybe she will get there and maybe she won’t.” Being a car releasing 0 carbon footprint, Maeby drinks waste vegetable oil from local restaurants instead of diesel. At first, I wondered if she releases any CO2 to the atmosphere and then I got my answer: she is not zero-emission. She just releases that CO2 from the land rather than deep underground! And she is neither zero-diesel use. She has to run on diesel until the temperature gets to 80 degrees Celsius and then switch to grease oil. So please don't misinterpret Peter’s meaning about the zero-carbon footprint cuz it actually cumulates emission and uses a little diesel.

I want to challenge others to think about this: are we more likely to change our lifestyle habits if we see an average family or individual do it, or if we see a celebrity partake in it. I have no doubt that people will say that a celebrity is more influential. However, I have to say that this film inspired me because an average individual, with similar resources as I do, shows me that I am capable of changing my habits. If a celebrity showed others that they chose this lifestyle, I would be astonished and skeptical. Celebrities, or at least most, have every resource at their disposal. They seldom rewear outfits they wear to events, which is a waste of resources. This film was refreshing. This realistic inspiration has shown me that I can purge my belongings and live minimalistic. I wish I had began purging earlier.

Being the Change: 
    <br><br>
This film really opened my eyes to how much change I can truly create as an individual to reverse the effects of climate change and lower my CO2 emissions. The film states, “individual action is just as important as collective action.” This somewhat contradicts what Ken incorporated into week 7’s assignments because he stated that the best thing we can do is vote for political action to be taken and that individual actions creates very limited change. I believe this was very pessimistic and we should encourage individual lifestyle changes because even small actions make a difference and are better than doing nothing. 
    <br><br>
The narrator of the film mentions how he lives by the notion of head, hands, and heart. You have to think logically about your decisions, take physical action, and make the decisions with a positive outlook and people you love in mind. 
    <br><br>
Some lifestyle changes he makes are composting, riding a bike and using a grease powered car when he absolutely has to, limited his flying, and not participating in the food waste epidemic. 
    <br><br>
A huge problem we must solve is limiting our food waste and lowering our production. The production of food exercises tons of non renewable resources and emits thousands of tons of greenhouse gases. On top of this the United States produces enough food to feed two whole American populations while fifty million Americans are food insecure and 30% of that food produced goes to waste. 
    <br><br>
Overall, after watching this film I feel much more inclined to make individual changes in my own life such as remaining vegetarian, composting, flying less, and opting for my bicycle rather than my car. I feel more encouraged to make these decisions after seeing how it improved the narrator of the film’s quality of life knowing he was living clean and making a difference in the world.

I agree with you that it is important to change the way we live. If we all have the attitude that nothing is going to change because I will be the only who changes, no is going to want to change. Instead we need to encourage a change in lifestyle and show others they are not alone and that the rest of us are with them and supporting them. I found Being the Change interesting because, like you said, He focuses on the little things like composting, biking, not being wasteful all while having a positive outlook. These are the things Peter chose to talk about even with his background in science. It wasn't some new technology he mentioned that was going to save our planet, it was simplifying our lifestyles. Like you mentioned, hands to fix things and not waste is very important to our planet, because it stifles the production of waste. I also think it is important to point out it is not good to discount Ken's comment about voting because that alone will cause the most significant collective change and put more things into place like a carbon tax that will then guide people to making more social changes.


<br><hr>

This film also opened my eyes in the same way. I haven't made any personal lifestyle changes during this class because I was more focused on participating in the coming presidential election for a candidate who would support the Green New Deal. I definitely feel bad that I haven't done as much as I should have individually now, because I see how much it can do. Towards the end of Being the Change, when Kalmus is talking with George Shea and Mike Farrell, he mentions that they are all just normal people, but they have had such a huge impact on the climate crisis movement compared to your average person. I think this just goes to show how it really is normal people who can take the climate crisis to heart and make a big change. I think this should be emphasized in our class, as with the right support from Ken, I'm sure there are many people in that class who could make a huge change in the world of climate.
    <br><br>
I also was a fan of Kalmus saying he is taking the middle path. It made him much more relatable to me, as someone who doesn't want to give up some things like having kids, etc., and that made me follow along much closer in the doc. Knowing that I can reduce my carbon footprint by a factor of 10 and still be able to have things I enjoy in my life is great, and actually makes me want to do these things, rather than taking a lot of things out of my life and only getting the satisfaction of knowing I'm helping save the planet. That is a nice feeling, but I feel like I would be much more involved in my reductions if I had more than just a feeling of satisfaction.
    <br><br>
This doc also inspired me to calculate my carbon footprint online and see what changes I can make this year in reducing that.



<br><hr>

 I agree with your comment. I really liked the idea of slowly raising the price of carbon based fuels each year and funneling that money back into the public rather than into growing government. However, I feel like it would be even better to funnel that money into creating eco-friendly jobs and into infrastructure that can facilitate individuals being the change that the planet needs. The gentleman with the leed certified house showed many expensive features of his house that made him capable of living with less emissions. Imagine if homeowners were granted money to make their homes emission free. Many Americans would not be able to afford this on their own but they could if they were supported. 
       <br><br>
  I love the idea of having your own home garden and composting. I feel like this is a great way to spend time with family and teach our future children about sustainable agriculture, or should I say regeneration since La Casa de Paz crossed our sustainability and replaced it with regeneration?  If we are going to have children we should spend time with them, working with our hands like the book suggests. We use our heads to instill a new way of living into the minds of our children. We are their best teachers. People are happier when they live in an eco-friendly manner and it shows. It gives people a sense of purpose and accomplishment. It's a healthier lifestyle in general too because all of your produce is fresh.
        <br><br>
 The guy in the trash suit made me laugh but also made me reflect on how wasteful we are as a society. It is also sad that we have this “out of sight out of mind” mentality. Words that resonated with me were “We throw stuff away but where is away? There is no away, there is planet earth.” Where does all of our trash end up? I know there are landfills but I never see them. Because these things are not right in front of me they can leave my mind so easily. I feel like America needs to become more conscious in general. We can be so mindless sometimes that it's painstaking to watch.

After watching the film, Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, I was surprised to see how much the man was able to reduce his carbon footprint by. I was extremely impressed with the modifications he made to the vehicle which he could flip a switch once the engine reached 80 degrees celsius then runs on vegetable oil. 
        <br><br>
One thing that I see as a major reason that he was able to do so is the privileges he has had in his life. He got an amazing education and a job which provided him the means to start making these lifestyle changes. Having come from an immigrant family myself and seeing the great distances my dad travels daily to go work a construction job I just think of how is one with these circumstances supposed to make the necessary lifestyle changes in order to reduce emissions. It’s not like some people can just stop commuting to their jobs because that is what keeps food on the table and a roof over their heads. The film did a great job of showing ways we can make modifications to our lives, but as for the extremes, the man in the film reached I don't see that as an attainable goal for the foreseeable future of most Americans.

I agree with your last point. Some of the changes in lifestyle were just too drastic. For example, using your own waste as compost to help grow plants in the backyard is a little extreme for many. The REALLY extreme one was the garbage digging. That is VERY unlikely to become widespread throughout the U.S.. I don't think anyone in there right mind would go out and do that willingly. I understood that the main point was to not let the food be thrown away like that, but there should be a better way to promote that idea. Besides that, I found the film very interesting. I found the vegetable oil car really fascinating.

“Individual action is every bit as important as collectivist action.”
        <br><br>
This quote from, “Being the Change,” was my main takeaway. This is an idea that, in my opinion, holds a lot of power. After last week’s lecture video, I felt really strongly that the idea that personal action as ‘not enough’ and insignificant in its impact on the world is an extremely poor and empty-headed mindset to have. I think we have to conceptualize when it comes to why personal actions are even worth changing your lifestyle for. Our personal actions aren’t meant to cause an immense, sudden wave of change. Our personal actions are meant to slowly but surely shape today’s existing societal norms and habits that fuel America’s unsustainable practices that are slowly killing our planet to the point of inhabitability. 
        <br><br>

There was a certain part in this film that I found to be very central to the purpose and message of “Being the Change.” Narrator, Peter Kalmus, tells Ed Begley that he could no where near afford the equipment that he had in order to live the optimally sustainable lifestyle he does. Begley responds that when he started, he couldn’t afford any of it either, but he did what he could and started small. He emphasizes that doing what you can and doing what you can afford is what this movement is encouraging.

I agree with your statement about personal actions influencing societal norms that most Americans take on. I know that a lot of people still don't believe the impact their actions have but I do see more people getting aboard on living a sustainable life. It's a domino effect that takes only one person who really cares to influence those around them. Just like Peter influenced his family to live sustainably, I've influenced my family and friends to be a little more considerate of the planet and its climate when making choices around diet and other forms of consumption. I've shared with my dad almost every film that we've watched in this course and he was shook. My dad, the person who exposed me to the danger the planet is in, was surprised at the information he was receiving. My dad has always been very conscious about the climate crisis and he's always been very environmentally-friendly but he now knows that he can do more and a lot of people don't know that they can do more because this information isn't as viral as it should be. I find that for myself and for other people I know, it's difficult to pass on such serious and heavy messages but sharing articles and films with our family and friends is one way to spread awareness on the climate crisis
        <br><br>


I think it helps a lot to visually see the lives of families like Peter's to know that it's possible to reduce your carbon footprint to 1/10 of that of an average American. I don't think people are going to fix their cars to run on veggie oil or compost their feces but I do see it very much possible for people to grow conscious of our issues and actually care about them the same way we care about those around us. Like Peter said, we need to spread this information however we can and however is best for us, whether its writing about it, singing about it, painting about it, etc. We need to really reach into people's hearts and the only way of doing that is by revealing the passion that's in ours. 

        <br><br>

People aren't going to stop shopping, eating animal/animal-based products, or driving their cars one day to the other but doing these things less frequently will reduce emissions and have a long-term impact on the climate. We unfortunately were fooled for many centuries by the idea that having more things would make us better and happier than others but we can fight capitalist pressures by saying no to their products and advertisements that belittle a simple, more fulfilling lifestyle. We need to leave behind our high-demand consumer culture and adopt a new American Dream, one that doesn't consist of having the car of the year, a lavish 3,000 sq ft house, or the trendiest outfits.


</span></div><hr>
<p>
"Being the Change" was an interesting film because Peter specifically walks the audience through his daily activities to fight the crisis and teaches the audience household methods in which we can reduce our fossil fuel usage. It's really unfortunate that even though most people are aware of the climate crisis, society isn't moving to do anything about it, and that brought a sense of panic for Peter. I found it interesting that Peter mentioned that once he had kids, he started wondering how the world will be when they grow up; this is intriguing because we always viewed the previous generation to be indifferent about the well being of the planet after damaging it. 
        <br><br>
I definitely agree with Peter's point that personal change is just as impactful as collective change. One of the largest problems we face in society is that we constantly think that our individual actions won't make a change because billions of others are not changing their lifestyles. However, because we are always thinking this, Peter contends that this pattern will continue ensnaring us until it is too late. He himself reduced his carbon footprint by more than a factor of 10 in 4 years, and he did this by having his car run through vegetable oil and diesel, focusing more on growing food and other crops, and finding ways to prevent the use of airplanes and vehicles.
        <br><br>
In the end, it's difficult to deny that many people perceive their eco-friendly actions as meaningless, because in reality, many people still do not change their lifestyles for their planet. However, making drastic and radical changes in our own individual lives can in turn inspire our surrounding communities to do the same. As Peter states in the film, although his actions are just a mere "small drop of water" in a bucket, it is still working to fight climate change.

I was also interested in how this film had older generations trying to change the future for the betterment of their children. I thought about how Peter’s children are growing up in a low emission home and will probably decide to continue that lifestyle as they grow older. People are drastically influenced by the life that they grow up in, and I hope that I can set an example of an environmental life for my children one day.

I think that personal action is very important in the fight for the planet. A part from the film that stuck with me was when Peter mentioned flying. He said that if you choose not to fly and that seat goes empty then there will be the same amount of emissions, but if 300 people choose not to fly then they fly one less plane. It all adds up. Making decisions for yourself and showing other people that they can make the same decisions can be very impactful. I think that several people would love to live a more environmental lifestyle but they just don’t know how. If you do some work in finding solutions for them and show them that it can be cheaper, make them more happy, and be easy, then people will join you.

I really resonated with your comment. I think this film was a really good way to realistically see how a single person can make changes in their life. It went along well with the reading and the lecture as they were all presenting actual concrete ways we can make change. I also agree that it was interesting how Peter was really only motivated to make change when he had kids. This life-changing event changed his perspective on the motivations of our lives. Kids bring the context of looking towards the future with a sense of betterment and the long term. This helped Peter to re-think how he was living in order for his kids to live in a habitable future. This is the way we all need to be thinking about whether we have kids or not. We can’t wait for a huge event to change our perspective as it will be too late. At this point, if we wait until we have kids to start changing our personal actions, it will be too late. 

        <br><br>

I also agree with what you said about personal action. I definitely can fall victim to the mindset that, as just one individual, I can’t make a difference. This is a dangerous mind for anything but especially dangerous with regards to the climate crisis. If every American and every human on this earth believes what they personally do will not make a difference, we will absolutely never make progress or change. It starts as a personal mindset, that translates to action. With that action comes communication, which will lead to the spreading of ideas, leading to more action. Political action as well has huge implications. We all need to live with this mindset, and I believe that if we do, our kids will thank us for it.

I think the situation is really urgent. I already saw the news about there are grasses growing on the Himalaya mountain, which is unusual to see. Also,  the methane in the North and South pole is released, which is dangerous for the whole planet. In addition, the virus contained in the North and South pole may be released because of the melted ice. There is so much news about the negative impact of global warming, and I don't understand why people still have no action regarding this, and some of them even believe there is no such thing called climate crisis. I think we must act now without a doubt. If we continue ignoring it, bad things will happen to us, and everyone will suffer because of it. It's time for us to change. Just as Ken says, we should be the change. If we act now and change now, we can slow the situation before it is too late.

Considering that I have already seen both of these movies in English 22, I wanted to rewatch “Tomorrow” since I still had a fresh memory of Peter Kalmus’  “Being the Change”. Honestly, I’ll admit that I didn’t watch “Tomorrow” all of the way through last time, because the time commitment it would take to sit down and watch a two hour movie on climate change. However, I feel as though now after watching the whole film, I missed out on a lot of interesting solutions that I had never had knowledge about beforehand. One issue I have found with the other films was that it was the same statistics being repeated over and over and the argument for combating the climate crisis was getting super repetitive. However this was not the case for the film “Tomorrow” a lot of the alternatives presented were things i had never heard about and amazed me due to the innovation presented. For example, the envelope/ paper company explored in chapter 3 of the movie was so innovative and inspiring to me. They purchased their raw materials from eco friendly producers, who when cutting down trees, planted four more in the process. Furthermore, they had a “green roof” which was something I had never heard about, which in simple terms is a roof filled with plants that absorbs any form of greenhouse emissions from the production of paper. Imagine if every company had put even half the effort that this company had into making their production eco friendly! Emissions would be greatly reduced and the quality of the work environment would increase greatly. In addition, the company was actually making a great profit from being green, in the movie they mentioned saving up to 17 million dollars. This is something that we as voters and consumers can encourage companies to take the step into becoming green, in which it is important to vote for local legislation that rewards eco friendly companies and buy from companies who value a green form of production.

Being the change is an important film to watch as you can see what life is like living for more sustainable and caring for the environment. I think the film also showed the benefits that people will read from changing their lifestyle. I walk around or take public transportation to get places and there is so much beauty around us and the perks of being a passenger in bus/train or walking is that you get to embrace it. I really like how the kids were also able to partake in the sustainable lifestyle and it was a family goal. The fact that they are a family of four and able to make environmentally choices shows that people can make this change. The change is always endorsed as a happy and healthy lifestyle so I don’t see why a lot of people aren’t already doing. I know people like to do things quickly and like the comfort of being in their own private car but so many interesting stories can be made by walking or taking public transportation.

I completely agree with you that this film had a unique and important take on climate change. Many people wonder if changing their lifestyles to one that is more environmentally sustainable will really play a significant role in impacting climate change. Just like with voting, people think that their singular vote won’t matter in the face of millions. But when everyone has this mindset, that’s where the problem arises. Huge chunks of people believe their vote or their lifestyle won’t make an impact on its own, so they give up altogether. If only they turned around and saw that together, if each of us took action, there would be a great difference in the world. 

        <br><br>

I think Peter Kalmus shows us this on a more personal level than most of the other films have. He illustrates his journey to a sustainable lifestyle and proves to us that even an average citizen and their family can do the same. It takes initiative, but after that, the ball just keeps rolling. And it’s not like you live a life longing for things you can’t have; instead, you live a life of fulfillment. 
        <br><br>


I really admired the head, hands, heart idea Kalmus came up with. To think with your head and do research, then physically act on your knowledge, and finally, find meaning in the entire process with your heart. We can all make changes like he did to our lives, and we all know it. It’s just a matter of when we’re going to do it, because we need to start now.

I loved the specific approach "Being the Change" took in talking about the climate crisis. 
        <br><br>

I especially enjoyed Peter Kalmus's idea of the head, the hands, and the heart. The head being understanding that there is a problem, the hands being actions to solve the problem, and the heart being the understand of the ultimate purpose, meaning, and value of the solutions.
        <br><br>

One lady in the film said that the best motivations are intrinsic motivations, or motivations that come from within oneself. For example, a person is more motivated to do something not when other people tell them to but when they are animated to do things that they feel truly align with their own morals/values. That same woman said that people who do things to help the environment are happier because they have more meaning in their lives.
        <br><br>

I found it interesting how Kalmus tied meditation to his response to the climate crisis. Meditation allows you to recognize that life is just a series of moments -- moments that ALL eventually come to an end. This allows you to appreciate life rather than feel like you have to struggle through it and hate it. Through appreciating life you are more motivated to find ways to prolong it, as you realize that no matter how hard life gets, it is all you have and therefore it is beautiful. This can be considered an intrinsic motivation. 
        <br><br>

I love all of the films we watch for this class. I feel as though the films always leave the biggest impact on me. Yes, the readings are very informative, but they don’t touch my heart. They only touch my head. In order for me to want to make a difference, I need to have that intrinsic motivation like they talked about in the film. I need to see the problem, I need to see the consequences of the problem, I need to see solutions, I need to see the value of those solutions, and most importantly I need to hear and watch other people and their actions in order to ground myself and recognize my own selfishness and ignorance.

Hi! I also really liked the idea of "Being the Change" as well. I think that so much is said just in the title but I loved seeing this idea play out throughout the film. This film was helpful for me to watch because I think it really shows and explains that your actions toward climate change matter. So many people think that what they could do won't have a big enough impact so they don't end up doing it. This film shows that while yes our actions may be small they still matter and can still make a difference. This is why I think it would be great for everyone to watch this film. I also really liked the idea about the head, the hands, and the heart. I think that it helps explain the process of how we should act towards the climate crisis. I think that all three of them are important to have and acknowledge. Lastly, I can agree with you that films most definitely have touched my heart more than readings which is why I think they are so important.

Your comment highlights for me the depth and magnitude that these lifestyle changes can have on a person. That solving a problem such as this one roots down to purpose and meaning on a deeper scale, a dramatic shift in perspective from the economically focused debate often surrounding this conversation. The idea that these sustainable efforts that let one "be the change" are also connected to meditation and generating the values to inspire intrinsic motivation is a promising perspective and offers a hopeful outlook on the progress that can be had. The lifestyles changes made in this documentary, and necessary to contribute to the climate solution, are grand and intimidating. One of the biggest resistances to these changes is the fear of loss of our material joys, so facing these difficult changes through a holistic effort like this purifies the issue and allows for a more natural and accessible shift in lifestyles. 
        <br><br>

One thing that continued to appear in my mind is the value of the life that Peter's children are being raised into. The morals, values, and choices that are being taught to these children as the foundation of what they know is providing them with a set of beliefs that will go on to allow them to avoid having to make the grand shift the rest of us are responsible for. For them, their adult life will be easier than that of their peers who now face a material loss that is forced upon them, rather than changes resulting from intrinsically motivated choices. I envy the lifestyle they are learning and hope for the opportunity to be able to learn similar values, and teach my own children and perhaps others as well of a sustainable life in my future.

I agree with your comment. I too enjoyed the film and how Peter Kalmus tells his story of how he is playing his part in reducing the climate. I enjoy films and articles like this that actually give you a solution instead of just simply stating the problem. I feel that this tends to give people hope because these solutions are things that they can start doing now. I do admit that the car that is powered by food oil may be a bit hard for some people to obtain, but as we have learned in previous weeks, there are other modes of transportation. I also do agree that when we help out the environment we tend to feel happier. I feel that this is applicable to any acts and gives us much more satisfaction with ourselves than going out and buying clothes. Lastly, I agree with how cutting out the things that you think will make you happier, but don't as it did for Kalmus, because he was able to turn to things such as meditation. Last quarter I took a yoga class and I truly enjoyed it and I felt that it made me less stressed in terms of everything that was going on in my life at the time. I really enjoyed the film, but there were moments where I got sad such as when Kalmus describes how he does not know what the future holds for his children. This is a very sad reality because none of us know what is going to happen in the future in terms of climate change. Hopefully people begin to make changes in their life such as the ones that Kalmus has made to drastically reduce his climate footprint.

I totally agree with you - I really liked Peter's idea of the head, the hands, and the heart, as being three essential pieces in the process of living an environmentally sustainable lifestyle. The heart, and intrinsic motivation, is key if someone is to change their individual lifestyle and habits. Most of us who are not making environmentally conscious choices are doing so because we don't feel a real desire or motivation to change. Like you said, watching inspiring films such as "Being the Change" is one way to reach the hearts of people. I know the film, and the others we've watched, personally reach me at a deeper level than articles or lectures. So yes, I believe people will only change their environmentally destructive ways if they feel intrinsically motivated and genuinely passionate to do so.

In "Being the Change," Peter Kalmus does the modern youtube version of a "week in his life." He introduces the ways he was able to cut down his carbon emissions from 20 tons to only 2. And he brought up several points that came up in my mind while watching this documentary. It was interesting to see how he approached this lifestyle, especially having kids. And it was cool to see the many ways that people approached living a sustainable life compared to his own take on it. While he takes on a middle-man stance because he still uses a car and in other small ways, he also shows scientists and other activists who use a different approach. Some relied on solar-panel energy and others like Peter grew his own vegetables, and some went "trash-digging." It was interesting to see them address the problem of food waste in the documentary as well. Watching "Being the Change," was motivating because I know in past lectures and videos,  we addressed how individual action does not really help compared to other ways like taking political action, but it was interesting to see how Peter gave visualizations to that in his documentary. In one scene, he begins with a single water droplet hitting a pool of water, and he slowly begins to introduce the same video in repetition but in one single scene. By doing so, he emphasizes that even though it is an individual action, if other people recognize this approach or if other people around the world are also making these changes, it will add up. He does this by comparing it to seats on an airplane and how even though it may feel pointless, especially if one seat on the flight is empty if enough people do not fly from 300 or 3000, that's fewer planes, and therefore fewer carbon emissions. 
        <br><br>
The documentary relies heavily on the community to encourage people to go green. With organizations like "Repair Cafe" in Pasadena or in Oakland where one of the activists grew his own vegetables and gave them for free to his neighbors, Kalmus shows how living a sustainable life can motivate people to contribute less to landfills, save money, and meet new people. In one instance, a man emphasizes how close he's become to his neighbors by cleaning the streets in their neighborhood. The film does a great job of discussing the importance of individual action and how we need to be the change we want to see. While it may be harder for some than others, there are still ways that you can help the environment which he shows through other scientists and activists in their approach to living sustainably. There were a lot of emotions that went through my mind as I watched this because at times I felt like it was pointless but at other times, I couldn't help but feel inspired by Peter Kalmus and his family. I think the climate crisis is very near and I think people are becoming more aware of its seriousness. While there are still skeptics/ contrarians out there, I think this film does a good job of demonstrating how we could still make changes in our own lives that can benefit the planet, even if it may seem small.

This short documentary is a good reminder that there are people around the world living sustainably and doing their part to share knowledge about different lifestyles. It is comforting to know that living minimally is not only good for the environment, but beneficial to the mind and soul. Peter Kalmus, and others, reveal that meditation can help one be more connected with themselves and the world, while allowing one to be present and truly enjoy a moment before it passes. Daily reflection can calm one down, destress, and lead to happier thoughts once your mindset changes. Personally, I have found happiness by directing my thoughts, energy, and emotions towards things that matter more. I do not find it worth my time or well-being to dwell on small, irrelevant, and non-vital issues, particularly if they should not concern me. I apply this to the little things, trying not to get too upset with myself when I am late to something, or cancel something when I already committed. Broader issues that concern the rights of other people still very much concern me. Just because I will not be as affected by something, such as climate change today or a sinister President, does not mean that I know the detrimental consequences it can have on many other people. The people in this documentary gain a lot of pleasure and contentment just from helping others, by giving away their time, skills, or items for free for their neighborhood and community. I agree that acting selflessly is good in and of itself, and if we all had this mindset, there would be far less problems; if we all act for others, we will always receive from others and there is a balance of give and take. Overall, “Being the Change” achieved its goal of educating people about the possibilities and opportunities they can personally take to make a difference and live better, more simple lives.

I liked the perspective that Being the Change took on climate action being something that comes from every aspect of your life, whether it be through your thoughts, your actions, or even through spiritual meditation that helps you feel more connected to both yourself and the world around you. I also appreciated how Peter Kalmus made his lifestyle seem very attainable because it makes normal people feel like the changes they want to make in their life are attainable and can have a real environmental impact, beyond being just a “drop in the bucket”. This concept of individual action leading to a collective shift in the way we interact with the world around us was really emphasized in this documentary. Along with this, the way they explained that the only way to make progress regarding climate change is through small, community-based, grassroots movements was very wise and I completely agreed. For someone like me, who is already interested in learning about solutions to climate change, this film was an effective tool to make me feel a little more proactive and optimistic about the state of the climate movement, but I don’t think it would be as effective for people who do not know much about this topic or do not believe in climate change. It also wasn’t very instructive on how to actually implement changes in your own life, but rather, it took a more emotional angle and essentially just gave a case study on one person’s life and the personal effects of the changes he made to it. The doc had a very uplifting tone, and I enjoyed it, but was overall not super impactful.

Both films offer very interesting views on dealing with climate change in different ways. With "Being the Change" Peter Kalmus offered ideas that could be applied in one's life to change the emission rate of one's household and how to connect with one's self through meditation, but I'm not a meditator as it doesn't work for me, but at least it works for some people and it helps center a person and brings them peace. Kalmus lives a very busy life as he is a father and works full time, so if he can adjust others can too, but I realize not all can go as far as he can due to financial reasons or where they live doesn't have a lot of opportunities so you do what you can. Community-based, grassroots are great as you can get people together to induce change or starting to have community gardens as I feel like getting people together where they feel connected with one another makes for a productive society. But something I wish more people understood is how as people can be willing to help, it just may not work in their schedules with crazy hours or maybe multiple jobs to make ends meet, so there shouldn't be judgement placed on them but to give them advice or guide them on how they can emit less would be wonderful it's just that getting the education to everyone isn't an easy process. The points you made were great and it can take one individual to embark on a path of societal change like it's happened before.

Tomorrow is a documentary created by a group of friends who all work in the film area. They discovered the rapid change of our planet, so they decided to do something. They visited several countries in different continents to reflect various perspectives. The documentary was divided into five parts, each introduced the story of people’s strive to improve the environment. The first one is agriculture. The group travelled to UK, Detroit, and France. Residents in these three places all grow their own food. Among them, I was most impressed by the actions of Incredible Edible. They plant vegetables in the flower gardens near busy streets so people can easily pick up mature food. Such usage of land is efficiency, and it also promotes the relationship among residents. The second part is energy. Fossil fuel is the main type of energy nowadays, but its combustion product brings harm to our ecosystem, which contributes to the 6th extinction in earth. People in Canada, Denmark, Iceland, and France create their own methods to replace huge usage of fossil fuel. Some of them employ renewable geothermal energy, and some of them use roof to collect solar energy, which brings a win-win partnership. The third part is economy. People who gain the most money will gain the most power. In order to weaken their power, we need to promote local business because the money will not all go to the pocket of large companies in this way. As a result, we can increase the power of people. The fourth part is democracy. Vote should not the only content of democracy. Instead, the full participation of citizens is the real democracy. The story in India is a successful example. We can find that the quality of people’s lives improved after the real democracy came. The last part is education. The documentary utilizes the school in Finland to show that the main goal is to teach children how to learn. I feel very optimistic after watching the documentary because I realize that there are so many people making efforts to create a better future. I would like to join them and step forward. A bright tomorrow is waiting for us if more and more humans realize the current problem and join in.

Being the change, was a climate change documentary that enforced a very organic and achievable standard of making changes in our actions. From beginning to compost, to wasting less food, and even riding a bike more often for health and environmental reasons, I think that the ideas explored in this documentary were very accessible. The narrator was a very smart individual, being a masters in physics from Columbia and then working at Caltech, yet he was make such simple changes in his lifestyle and anyone could make an effort to do. The narrator even went as far as stopping the use of gasoline in his car and switching to alternate fuel sources such as diesel and vegetable oil. Especially considering he was living in the LA/ SoCal area, this was a bold, courageous move that anyone could admire. Although it may have made life harder in the short term, the overall experience was very positive from him, as he found to take joy in the small things and live moment to moment. This ultimately led to a far more enriching life as he also took part in meditative practices and volunteered his time to help others who are less fortunate. I think the narrators point on trying to live less frugally can be applied to a majority of our lives, and it really speaks to how many of us may claim to be climate change conscious but aren’t really enacting as much of change as is needed. On my opinion, the narrator really took an effort to make as many changes in his life that would be environmentally conscious, even reducing his flight time and also becoming vegetarian. He basically enacted all the ideas that we have considered in this class, and I think if there was one movie to show someone who is considering climate conscious changes, it should be this one. It perfectly encapsulates what we all need to aspire to be at, because if we don’t start making little changes in our lives as soon as possible, it will be even harder to convince legislators and policy makers that this is an issue in the severity that it actually is.

This film made me think about my own future after college. Peter studied and worked in a different field that he enjoyed, but decided to move away from that to pursue climate action, because he thought it was more important. I am lucky enough to be learning about the climate crisis now, and it has definitely influenced my idea of what I’d like to do after graduating. I also really liked seeing how his family made so many sustainable changes. This also made me think about my own future, and how I can keep my footprint small as I get older and have a family of my own.

The film "Being the Change" was pretty inspiring considering the way of life that this family led. It really truly reflects the idea that once you make one change, the rest are much easier to make. Their creativity and willingness to go the extra mile were very inspiring and I feel like some of the changes that they were making in their personal lives could be modified and applied to everyone's lives. For example, the vegetable oil car stuck out to me the most, as I'm sure it did with most watchers. It was something out of the ordinary "eat less red meat" and "turn off the lights" solutions that we're used to hearing. With a little more imagination and some engineers behind the idea, we could probably turn this idea into something that can take over for cars as we know them today. If we got the support from the public and did things like this that wouldn't completely alter their entire lives we may be able to get more people behind the idea of making changes in their life in response to climate change. I think that we are approaching the problem of climate change wrong and I know we need drastic measures but if we make drastic changes while letting people continue to drive their cars etc. it would go over much better.

I would have to agree with you on the creativity and willingness in finding solutions to everyday activities. I personally wanted to state that this documentary was a refreshing change for the reason stated above. Another aspect I quite enjoyed watching was the tinker fair. It is a way where people can keep things out of landfill, decreasing consumerism, and keeping both the customer and the repair people happy too. And how could I not mention the humanure section of the documentary. The reason why Peter and his family started this type of compost was due to the history of migration within the country. 
        <br><br>


Ken pointed out something that stuck with me, the road to happiness is paved with carbon. Meaning, we say people have it all, but on second thought… do they really? Trying to rethink the way I , and most of society, have grown up is quite mind boggling. It is quite unfortunate that society has been taken advantage of with consumerism, green consumerism, etc. The fact that we do need to be slightly skeptical of those in power as well as corporations is also quite unfortunate considering we are all living on the same earth, yet we are destroying it one day at a time with each choice we make.  However, it is necessary to change the way we live for the sake of the planet.

I actually really enjoyed watching this film; unlike most of the other films we've watched so far, I was left feeling with a sense of hope. The biggest takeaway from the film for me is the potential taking personal action has to turn into collective/community action. It was rather inspiring to see Kalmus take a feeling of dread and hopelessness over climate change and transform that into a process of action that consequently transformed his life as well. I think that this could become a reality for many people who decide to take personal action because it really makes you take a step back and reevaluate so many different aspects of your life--what we consume, how we consume, why we do it, etc.--and once you do that you really realize that the way our society functions right now is all sorts of f*cked up. When Kalmus was talking about meditation he described as being able to see that life is a series of moments moving on to the next moment, in that very moment. We live in a society that is constantly expecting us to not only consume, but produce as well (consider how much it's become normalize to overwork yourself and how that's viewed as being successful/hard working). As it was mentioned, we are in the state that we are because society always wants more. I truly believe we have a responsibility to critically analyze that idea and think about how we can do better. I think it was Kalmus who said something about getting the word out any way you can, although it might've been someone else who said it. I feel like everyone is capable of contributing something different when it comes to climate action or just activism in general. I thought about a lecture I attended last quarter on the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement and the professor mentioned how everyone has their different interests/strengths and that everyone can contribute something meaningful in that sense. For example, some people are very artistic so they can spread awareness through their art while others may be more focused on sciences and can contribute through research. Something else that I admired about this film was the local, community-based actions that were taking place. I wholeheartedly support a federal GND, but not every community has the same needs/issues to address and so I firmly believe that community-based actions are very important when looking for ways to reduce emissions. It was nice to see that the community came together and came up with their own solutions to reduce food waste and consumption. Overall, I was left feeling inspired by the film.

I really enjoyed reading your comment, so thank you for sharing! Throughout this quarter I feel like so many students, including myself, have commented back to Ken saying that we feel dreadful of not being able to turn this crisis around, that it seems like there's no hope. The biggest takeaway from this film for me as well, is how personal action alone can create individual success that can be implemented within a community. We live in a society where we are encouraged to live our life as if it was our business, praised for overworking our minds and our bodies. Like you said, we are running off of this mental to produce and consume until we cannot any longer. We as humans seem to always want more, always wanting things to be better, bigger, nicer, and prettier. It would be nice that instead of wanting these things for ourselves, we want them for our planet and our people in more ways than just superficial. It is classes like the one we are in now that forces us to slow down and think about what we actually need in our life rather than what we want, and how what we want is actually very detrimental towards what we need. What kind of future do we want for ourselves and for the future generations, for the planet and for the animals? I really enjoyed reading the part you wrote about how using people’s different interests and strengths contribute in their own meaningful way to the shared issue. It is hard to envision myself or others willingly living the life that Peter Kalmus is, however it is inspiring that the decisions we make for ourselves can effect the changes others make for themselves as well.


<br><hr>
I wholeheartedly agree with everything you said in this comment and love that you addressed directly how warped the values and behaviors of our society in the present actually are. I think that two things in particular that you addressed that were skimmed over by most of the other comments I read on the film are the engagement in and value of meditation practices and the difficulty in adhering to a universal GND. Firstly, I think that a large part of why meditation and similar mindfulness practices are so overlooked and undervalued in our present day society is that they often produce perspectives that do not support our current consumption behaviors and capitalistic values. We are programmed by our society to function off of a feeling of incompleteness, which has bred us all into stressed out, materialistic servants of capitalism who have too little energy leftover at the end of the day to do anything but go home, eat, and sleep just to start the whole exhausting process over again the next day. All of this in the name of being wealthy enough to consume more. 

        <br><br>

Specifically, I liked Peter’s friend’s use of the term “phantom wealth” to describe this mentality where we have come to believe that the number and monetary value of our possessions in any way equates to fulfillment and happiness. We are constantly being taught that this is the undeniable truth and a condition to which we must continually aspire, even when our wealth is so great that all of our true needs have been met 10x over. This is where the value of meditation comes in. Though I have fallen out of my night time meditation routine due to the impracticalities associated with playing my music or guided videos out loud with a roommate present, on the occasions where I do make the time and space to meditate, my mental health and sense of fulfillment drastically improves in the days that follow. I think each and every one of us has something to learn (or unlearn) from practicing meditation and that we as a society should de-stigmatize it as a “hippie practice” and try our own hand at it in whatever way is most comfortable for each of us. 

        <br><br>

To your point about different communities having different needs and the difficulty of employing a universally effective Green New Deal, fortunately, there are some cities, states, and local representatives taking up the task of creating localized, targeted resolutions based largely off of the structure of the federal Green New Deal legislation to make changes that will be effective and achievable for individual communities as their environments determine. This is something that I think should be talked about more and pushed as a major running/campaign point for those running for local public office in the years to come. While these types of resolutions have not yet made significant headway, if sincere energy and time is put into developing these types of local resolutions in combination with a larger, all encompassing federal GND, I think we have a much greater potential as a country for enacting effective climate change policy in ways that will work for everyone and accommodate for the varied needs of our population.

<br><hr>
I couldn’t agree with you more. Like what you stated in your comment, unlike other documentaries we’ve watched this quarter, this film, “Being the Change”, leaves hope for us. After watching this film, I felt like I could clearly see the connections between personal and community actions and their interdependence with each other. Also, I found this film extremely informative that I could learn a lot from Peter’s eco-friendly lifestyle and I really appreciate what he did in such a sustainable way. For instance, Peter’s vegetable-oil-driven car and his family’s compost toilet impressed me on a huge level and I considered those as innovative movements. Moreover, as he was mentioning the meditation practice, I was really able to reflect on what I learned from the course of Zen Buddhism and I thought that it’s definitely a great way of refreshing ourselves and building essential elements during that process. I would be doing meditation practices when I was thinking my lifestyle went off in the wrong direction. I would suggest that everyone should definitely at least try to do meditation for a couple of times since the benefits of it have been certified and well documented. In brief, this is a great film showcasing how a sustainable lifestyle looks like and I’ll follow it with the best of me.

Tomorrow is a fantastic film that takes a slightly different approach to the climate change issue. The film begins with a shocking revelation: part of mankind may go extinct before the end of the century. This sparks a mission by Cyril Dion, Melanie Laurent, and others. The group goes around the world attempting to learn what can be done to avoid this catastrophe. What I most enjoyed about this film was the message of hope that permeated throughout it. While some of the other documentaries we have watched have come across as more doom and gloom, this film really focused on positive actions being carried out across the globe. The film investigated different areas of daily life, such as agriculture and energy, and showed how much of an impact slight changes can make. Similarly to Cowspiracy, the potential of decreasing the amount of meat eating in our society was discussed. I was truly amazed when the group travelled to Copenhagen and was able to analyze the actions the people there are taking. They use renewable energy sources to power the whole city, and nearly 70% of the people refrain from using private cars. This is already sparking great change over there, and I spent along time contemplating the results of change like that being implemented across the world. The film also highly emphasized the importance of educating people on the gravity of the situation and the need for change. I totally agree with this, as I feel the general public does not truly grasp the urgency that is required to combat climate change.  Towards the end, the film, discusses that a major cause of this problem is humanities tendency to be selfish. While I had not considered this before, I realized that is totally accurate and with slight adjustments to our ideals, we can make a great impact before it is too late.

I myself enjoyed this film and the message it sends to the general public however, this style of life is almost impossible for the masses. The more and more things that we look into show us how people with money and the ability to change their lifestyles, but what about the common people. Yes bikes are realistic for those who are 20 to 30, live alone or maybe married and have the ability to take time to get places, but what about those that need cars. My friends dad is a painter who paints houses and commercial buildings, my question is, how would get his supplies around efficiently on a bike. Even if he found a way, the speed of a bike considerably limits the amount of jobs he can do in a day as well as makes his job harder. The problem with the class in my opinion is that we look at everything through 1 scope, not a range of them. We need to focus less on the culture of the nation and focus more on the ability for us to introduce renewable energy on a large scale.

The one thing that really struck me about Being the Change was the fact that it addressed the anxiety and fear of helplessness in the face of climate change. Pete's turn to meditation and focusing on his own agency in mitigating climate change was inspirational. It was something I was able to relate to because if I'm being honest, this course has made me feel a lot of anxiety at the fact that I cannot by myself stop climate change, rather it takes an army. Referring back to Gandhi's saying of being the change, it was amazing to see Pete take initiative and be the change that he wants to see. 
        <br><br>
Learning about freeganism was interesting and I learned a lot about the wasteful practices of the food industry. The fact of the matter is that we can all go vegan, but the sunk cost of putting eggs on the shelf will not be mitigated because they're already produced. It's terrible that if one egg is cracked that the entire carton has to be thrown away. Seeing how much perfectly good food is thrown away through the Food Fiasco Project was astounding and inspires me to go urban foraging both for environmental reasons and for money saving reasons. They're giving away perfectly good food to dumpsters - eventually that food will produce methane. 
        <br><br>
Seeing all these efforts to reduce individual environmental impact in more attainable ways was really encouraging, especially the community repair shop days where people would make an effort to fix things instead of replacing them. Ultimately, Pete made reducing your carbon footprint seem more attainable.

I was also interested by the psychology talked about in Being the change, specifically the climate disorders.  For example either being too scared and running away from climate action, or being called to action. I would hope that everyone who feels threatened by climate change would take action, but that is not the case.  I am also reminded of kids who are having anxiety and panic attacks in 1st and second grade because they learn about the dangers of climate change.  This touches on the lecture for the week about how to effectively communicate about climate change.  We want as many people as possible to take action, and not be overwhelmed by anxiety and fear.  This means that people who are already taking action need to recognize that some people will struggle taking action due to the Goliath-like task of conquering climate change. We also need to re-examine how we approach the topic of explaining climate change, and see if we need to change how we explain its severity to different groups of people.  I think if we are able to confront this challenge, more people will be willing and able to join in the fight against the most dangerous thing our world faces.

Being the Change was an interesting and educational documentary in that it effectively communicates the multiple ways and methods the audience and other ordinary citizens can incorporate into their lives to save our planet. After watching this documentary, I had a renewed sense of knowledge in the impacts and importance of personal actions facing the climate crisis. Although the environmentally-conscious actions committed by single individuals may not mean much as their actions are most likely to be a drop in the ocean and would not have any immediate large-scale results, when many individuals from different parts of the world are being voluntarily environmentally-conscious and are doing everything they can in their daily lives to reduce their personal carbon emission into the atmosphere while spreading the information and actions of environmental activism throughout their local neighborhoods and communities, then these individuals are no longer alone in their journey to alleviate climate change as more people will join their actions and contribute enough momentum to this trend to create an influential, impactful movement on fighting climate change starting from personal actions. 

        <br><br>

The green and environmentally-conscious lifestyle and decisions made by Peter Kalmus and his family have set up a very nice example for the majority of the population to follow if we want to save our planet and all of its lives from the destructive consequences of climate changes. It might be very difficult to attempt to make all the necessary changes in our daily lives with the climate in mind like the Kalmus family in a short amount of time, it is still worth to try and worth the effort because we can start following the model and actions of the Kalmus family in smaller beginner baby steps including forgoing meat and automobiles once in a while and try to eat a largely plant-based diet and take public transportation or bike or walk to school and work. Once we are comfortable with integrating those smaller changes and steps in our lives for a certain time, we can then proceed to the next step and try to make those lifestyle changes stay and adhere to them the best of our abilities. This is not going to be an easy process but just as the documentary mentioned, we do not have much time left and we need to act now otherwise the entire planet including ourselves would render to utter annihilation by the planet in the future not so far away. 

        <br><br>

One interesting point brought up by the documentary is how happy the Kalmus family is after they implemented changes and alternations in their day-to-day life to reduce their carbon footprint as well as in the case of the Repair Cafe in Pasadena that both the customers and technicians are very satisfied and happy with the idea of repairing their old tools rather than purchasing new ones. In the modern American society that is subjected to heavy influence and perpetuation of consumerism, capitalism, and materialism along with the ideal materialistic-rich lifestyle demonstrated through the well-known American dream, people tend to assume that the more stuff and the more things they purchase the happier they will be. All of the commercials and advertisements on the television and social media seem to communicate to us consumers the message that happiness is equivalent to the amount of material wealth that we are in possession of, such as the houses we live in and the cars we drive. However, as Being the Change points out, that is simply not true. Material wealth, like it is explained in the documentary, is only phantom wealth and they would not bring true happiness to people and make them happier as they buy more stuff. On the contrary, the opposite seems to be true that when people have so much stuff and they do not know what to do with them since they never would need so many things, and these people may fall into depression because they realized that they are not finding more happiness in the stuff they buy but rather more troubles and worries. By eliminating unnecessary stuff in our lives and keeping the stuff we have longer through repairing, we are not only contributing to the overall positive cause of climate change by reducing our carbon footprint, but we are also doing ourselves a huge favor in that we can find true happiness and particularly meaning and purpose in life through these environmentally-conscious actions. We are able to connect with others in our communities more and we know that our actions have a purpose and goal, which is protecting ourselves, our future generations, and the environment.

I agree with you that even though our small lifestyle changes is like a drop in the ocean. It's small. But our actions, and the way we justify our actions can help influence others around us. I have told my friends that I try to cut beef off my diet. They joke about it, but the fact that I get them to talk about it, mention about it shows that my lifestyle is being put to thought, and it could leave a remembrance in the long term. I hope I will be able to grasp on my actions and continue to progress, eventually, eat much less protein, and perhaps plant based diets, and use e-bikes. For now I'm going to continue to do my small lifestyle changes and be proud and loud about it.

I was fairly impressed by the sustainability journey of Peter Kalmus. His ability to cut down his emissions so much and the things that contributed to his lifestyle change decision were compelling. His story was inspiring in many aspects, but also extremely challenging to face the truths behind our materialistic lifestyles. Many of the things he had struggled with before, I am struggling with now. It was thought-provoking and reassuring to see that somebody could innovate ways to improve the sustainability of their lifestyle. For example, his vehicle runs totally on waste vegetable oil, and instead of using fossil fuels that come from the ground, it uses oil that came from carbon dioxide that was already in the air so that no new emissions are added into our atmosphere. This type of lifestyle must be incredibly difficult, but also incredibly rewarding in various ways. He seems to be a very wise person, and I think the fact that he meditates for two hours every day is probably one of the ways he stays grounded and in touch with himself and reality in general. He seems to be incredibly selfless, yet he also somehow maintains a lifestyle that keeps him happy so its not like he’s neglecting his own needs in order to protect the environment. He’s a normal person just like us but lives the sustainable lifestyle the majority of us in this class want to be living. 
        <br><br>
Though I did enjoy this film, I felt that it was hard to find a central message in the midst of it all. It seemed to flip around quite a bit which made it hard to follow in my opinion. I got lost during a few parts, especially when he started talking about his tattoo and the volunteer center he was at. It’s kind of threw me for a loop because its hard to follow what the meaning of it all is and how it all ties in. I think the biggest success of this film was showing us that if we really want to make a change there are ways and being sustainable is more accessible than it may seem in today’s world.

The film does effectively communicate its subject by using personal experience to appeal to audience’s emotions. This documentary film records a PH.D ‘s life and what he is thinking during his life details, such as thinking for his kids and saving the environment by personal actions. He deeply knows that if a person wants to change the vibe of the society, his should start with his own actions and then influence the people nearby, such as the main character starts to connect with Cal tech, then finally gradually expands boarder and boarder. From my perspective, I think the audiences are mainly people who are casual viewers. Firstly, because the documentary video is surprisingly interesting and attractive, since the main character just simply takes people into his family scenes and tries to let people stay at the same vibe as himself, which tends to draw more attention from the casual viewers instead of the professionals. Such as using wasted vegetables oil and using “ head, hands, and heart” to represent his perspective as using” head to think, hands to act, and heart to find the meaning for life”. He masterfully uses life details to touch people’s feelings and makes people feel like they can achieve these goals which seem small too in order to successfully influence more casual viewer’s attitude towards protecting the environment little by little.
        <br><br>

I generally am in favor of the vibe of the film, since it is so lively and real. The main character even introduces meditation to express the life attitude and he suggests protecting the environment should also be a thing that people get used to do naturally for multiple reasons, such as for their kids. Ordinary life details really touches people’s feelings and  makes people want to do everything to maintain that kind of life- happy marriage whether with or without kids. In general, I learnt a lot of ways to protect the environment in details, such as using solar energy to support the family power use, saving food waste, since 40% of food waste in the dumpster in the US so that I can do more for protecting the environment than before. People even start “repair cafe” to help people repair and then reuse the stuffs they have. And I would be optimistic towards the environmental situation as always, since not only the nature has the ability to adjust itself, but also people are always reflecting themselves to support life and save the planet- to be the change itself. I would recommend it as 3 out of 5 to my friends who recognize the importance of protecting the environment so that they would understand the importance of the unbreakable cycle towards the Earth.

One thing that really stuck out to me was the scene about meditation. For me personally, meditation has become something I've learned to rely on when things get particularly rough. My junior year of high school was definitely one of my lowest points in terms of my mental health and overall happiness, and it was really hard for me to feel one way but try and put on a face for everyone else. I remember getting back from school one day and deciding that I was tired of feeling so down all the time and so naturally, like any other teenager, I went to google to answer my problems. Typically you would get a bunch of random tips and steps to solve your problems, but one thing I read that actually seemed like it could work was meditation. I don't mean to be cliche or cheesy when I say this, but meditation honestly turned my life around for the better. Whenever things would get rough I would turn to meditation, and eventually I would meditate simply because it was a great stress reliever and made me feel good. Another thing I really enjoyed while watching this film was honestly how wholesome everything was. Here is a family trying to combat and reduce their carbon footprint on the world, while raising a family in what I think to be a loving and educating way. If anything it kinda showed me how I would like to raise a family. I don’t know that I could necessarily be as green as they were and not drive my kids to school everyday, but I would honestly say they are a kind of model for what I would like to do in the future.

The "Being The Change" documentary was a really interesting way for me to see the connections between individual and community action; I felt that things like Pancho's "Casa de Paz" showed a deep link between individual and group action whereas we have been analyzing them as separate issues during our class time. Individual actions are not isolated things, as we don't exist as isolated beings; we exist in families within larger communities. When Pancho gives away his free fruits, he is building connections with his community and encouraging them to follow in his non-materialistic footsteps. When the Repair Cafe group helps people fix their objects, they motivate them to be more environmentally friendly in other areas of his life.

I liked seeing how individual action could lead to group change at a grassroots level. This film reminded me of "Cool Blocks," an organization in Isla Vista where students go door-to-door and come up with plans with their neighbors on composting and reducing waste in their households. Within 7 weeks, those who participate reduce their carbon footprint by 20-30%. This is all based off of not INDIVIDUAL action, but community action. Personally, people in my community have also motivated me to reduce my own carbon footprint; I cook a lot in the kitchen in my dorm and a lot of the other people who use the kitchen are vegan. Through becoming friends with them after repeated encounters in the kitchen, I've been motivated to cook vegan meals of my own so that I can share with them and also reduce my carbon footprint. I am now working on cutting animal products out of my diet slowly thanks to their individual actions having an impact on the community I belong to,

The documentary "Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution" definitely puts emphasis on the potential change that could happen in a tight knit community and it inspired me to think about ways in which I could start influencing other people as well even if it means to sacrifice some of my gains. I agree with you on the notion that we have to realize the fact that sometimes collective actions are equally important as individual actions. In fact, they are often inter-related, and the growth in one aspect often leads to another. Personally I could see how individual actions can lead to group actions because once a single person starts influencing other people and as time passes, the actions become collective as more people are encouraged to act. For example, one of my closest friends back home is actually vegetarian and he influenced a lot of people including myself to become environmentally conscious when we choose our diet. I feel like people need to put aside their disagreement about whether individual or collective action is more important because they're equally important. Acting upon what we know and learned should be our priority.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. “Being the Change” sends a message to the audience about how each person can reduce emitting fossil fuels and help the crisis of climate change. The atmospheric scientist, Peter Kalmus, showed how he found satisfaction through doing some small things like meditation, driving his car with wasted vegetable oil, riding a bike or walking to the workplace and so on. Not only these things brought a better life for him and his family but also contributed a bit to the environmental protection. The documentary also points out that anyone who is interested in saving the environment should encourage the people around him or her to try to do the same thing and spread the message as widely as possible. It is true that the power of a group would change things better than an individual’s own work. I learned a great deal of information about climate change and ways to take care of myself while helping the environment.

I left watching this film with a newfound hope, it was reassuring to feel like even a small lifestyle change can make a difference on the planet and in society.  The only thing about this film is that it doesn’t give many options for those who are not comfortably middle class and above.  Not everyone can carry everything they need for work in a backpack so that they can ride a bike to work instead of taking their car.  It seems like one big cycle of earning in order to cut back.  You can’t cut back on things you don’t have the opportunity or resources to cut back on.

I think a common theme throughout this course and the films included in it is self-awareness. The ability to take a step back from yourself and realize what you are doing to affect the environment, economy, social structure, and your own personal physical/mental health. Peter seemed to be extremely self-aware in this film, but most importantly he took action after gaining this awareness. I guess there is just something about reduced zero CO2 emissions that just makes everyone feel good. Reducing your carbon footprint by 90% like Peter did can be a challenge with a high rate of failure if you try to eliminate everything at once, so it would be my personal opinion that eliminating behaviors toxic to the environment one step at a time would be best, as displayed in the film. For example, if you know you want to eliminate your dietary carbon footprint, start by eliminating just beef from your diet as it carries the most deleterious health and environmental repercussions. Eventually eliminating all animal products would be the goal, but if someone tried to do such a thing all at once it would be more likely that they would give up and reintroduce all animal products. However, by knowing that you are fine without beef (but perhaps not without fish or eggs and what not) then you would be able to know you do not feel the need to have ALL animal products. If one could permanently eliminate beef from their diet for the rest of their life it would have a drastic reduction on their carbon footprint.

I was thinking the same thing in terms of common themes within this course. I think if anything, it has taught me to be conscious and mindful. It is so simple to be brainwashed by society; from the clothes you buy, the things you eat, even the things that you like are all influenced by our capitalistic society and we often fail to see the effects it has on our environment and own mental health. A great takeaway is just to be more self aware, just like Peter is in the film. I agree with you that it is quite overwhelming to try and reduce your carbon footprint so drastically in a small amount of time. This means that it's ok to start slow and quite frankly, I think a great start to approaching all of this is just to be more mindful with decisions. You don't always have to make the "right" one, but as long as you're educated and conscious of your actions, following your moral compass comes much easier.

This film was quite interesting to me because it showed how good humans can be, yet it was compared to how inefficient and greedy we can be. It showed that we can fix this world we just need to actually try to change the world. It was a very optimistic film and it encouraged me to make changes and encourage people around me to make changes. There were some very surprising statistics such as we can power this world on 60% less energy. There were also some very innovative ideas and some simple ideas that can help us save the world. Yet, these ideas only work if people can learn to trust each other and work together, the world can only be saved with the unity and coming together of humans. People are greedy in nature, yet to save this planet we need to be generous and trusting. I think that overall people are starting to improve, but the amount of improvement needed to save the planet is quite steep. I thought this film was more boring than a lot of the other films, but it was cool getting to see all the things that needed to change and how people were having creative solutions to these problems. Fighting the end of the world is going to take a couple rounds to end, but overall if people want to save the world and are actively trying to, the world will be saved. I love this planet and this class has really enlightened me on how I can help save it, so I am going to take some of these ideas from the film and apply them to my life so I can contribute.

I really enjoyed the movie "Being The Change" as it followed the life of an ordinary man, Peter Kalmus, who managed to drastically reduce his carbon footprint while still being able to live a normal life with his wife and two children. I found it really inspirational and educational to learn about all the changes he made in his life that helped him be more ecofriendly and aware of his emissions. One of the things he said in the beginning of the film was that his sons actually made him rethink his damaging lifestyle as he imagined what the world will look like when his children are all grown up. This definitely resonated with me since one of the main reasons why I don't want to have children is that I wouldn't want them to grow up in a world where they have to deal with the consequences of our mistakes. It really makes me wonder why there aren't more parents who become persuaded to reduce their carbon footprint when they think of the planet their children are going to be left with. Future generations will have to fix what we were too selfish to stop and I simply don't think that's fair. 
        <br><br>
Another line from the movie that really stuck with me was when Peter Kalmus talked about how important individual action is. I believe that there are many people out there who underestimate how big of an impact they have on the climate. Even I have to admit that sometimes I wonder if it really makes a difference if I don't eat that piece of chicken or take the bus instead of my car. Our actions sometimes seem so insignificant that it is difficult to stay positive and optimistic. Even if I stopped eating animal products and I was somehow able to convince my friends and family to do the same, climate change wouldn't stop just because of that. It takes all of us to change our habits in order to truly make a difference. This is why I really liked "Being The Change". It gave us a real-life example of somebody who successfully reduced his carbon footprint and still manages to live a normal, fulfilling life. It definitely sparked a feeling of "if he can do it, I can do it" in me. Maybe movies like this are what it takes to convince people that making a change is not that hard. Maybe climate change education should be less about "here's what's wrong and why we're all doomed" and more about "this is what our life could look like and - guess what - it's not as bad as you think."

First, I agree with your point that individuals can do little things to protect our environment. At the beginning of this movie, the director Peter Kalmus said that “when my first son was born, everything changed.” Since he found environmental problems truly can affect his next generation, he tried to reduce emissions by a factor of 10. This movie is effectively communicating the subject by using many examples not only from the director himself but also many people from different fields. Some general people who have children would have the same feeling as the director Peter Kalmus. They would try their best to protect the environment for their children. For those who are concerned about environmental problems, they may have a better understanding of this movie and more evidence for their research. At the end of the film, it says, “ whatever you do, do it in the spirit of dance gracefully, then with a smile.” It means although we have no way to save the whole world, we can take small steps from our daily life. This movie definitely will give us a new way to think about our behaviors and lifestyles to protect our environment.

This week's film was quite interesting and enjoyable as the main character's motivation is truly admiral. Peter is a climate change activist and understands the importance of reducing one's carbon footprint so he did exactly that and adopted a much more ecofriendly lifestyle, eventually only emitting 1/10th of the carbon amount an average American family emits. With having children, he first hand has a connection to future generations, further incentivizing him to make efforts to ensure a healthy earth for them to experience in the future. This is not only admiral from an environmentalist perspective as he has taken many steps to live a more sustainable life, but it is inspirational from an outside perspective as well as he had beliefs and goals and he actually took action through configuring his daily life in order to reach his goal of living a more environmentally conscious and sustainable life. With doing even difficult things such as biking far to work rather than driving every day, his actions showed true dedication.
        <br><br>


Thus, this not only motivated me to take action but made me realize the distinction between the two different levels of being environmentally conscious and actually making a change. How important or meaningful is it to be environmentally conscious and aware of the effects certain lifestyle choices have on accelerating climate change if you aren't taking action to prevent it. As a society, we need to work to not only be environmentally conscious but to be like Peter and actually take action on these beliefs and making an actual difference. As more and more people hop on board and start actually making a difference I am sure it will soon become a large trend and better our planet's health.

I like how you emphasized the distinction between learning and taking action. As we talk about this weeks theme of spreading information and making change through dialouge and education, I feel like many people don't take the extra step beyond doing what they think is morally correct for them. The whole situation it seems like the odds are stacked against change. If we can get through to someone, if they want to change, if they make major changes, if they stick with these changes, if they also vote, if they spread the word. For every level someone moves up, the more impact. they can make in the world. If they decide to do it. I liked the format of the film, how it followed a specific person. I felt that it made the topic more relatable and not too preachy, and was significantly inspiring to me. It emphasized most of what we've been talking about in class; the importance of balancing personal lifestyle, activism, and political action. I think it emphasizes personal lifestyle a little much, but that makes sense because it is most important to live your values and on a case by case basis it is what feels the most productive to each person.

This film "Being the Change" the magic that occurs when one chooses to live a life of intention. Rather than being focused on material and economic concerns, you can choose to be happy with living with less and with being intentional with all of your choices and purchases. Intentionality leads to being more present and being more present leads to happiness. I am inspired by how Peter chooses to live his life. Right now I eat at the dining hall, but I definitely want to experiment with freeganism next year. Living at UCSB naturally results in a reduced carbon footprint as everyone buses and bikes. However, when I go home during the summer I use my car way more often than I'd like to admit. This summer I want to make more intentional choices when living at home. For instance, I teach at a yoga studio that's a 30 minute drive from my house. There are yoga studios closer to me that I could work at and instead of driving to I could just bike to. Lastly, I think meditating is something everyone should do because it helps clear your head and allow you to operate your day with less mental chaos.

I agree, it was so interesting to see how Peter lived his life. I found it amazing how he was able to reduce his carbon footprint while still living a normal life. Like you mentioned a very important aspect is him being so aware. I still am amazed that he was able to reduce his emissions from 20 to 2. The film left me inspired as well. I want to work harder to focus on the choices I make and to require less stuff to make me happy. I agree that it is so nice biking everywhere. When I first went off to college I thought I would miss the idea of “freedom” that comes with driving. But I do not at all, I feel as if a bike gives me just as much freedom and I am able to get myself all around campus. I wish the bus system was a little more reliable because I always find myself waiting forever. But I agree that when I go home I will most likely continue to drive my car, because I do not live in walking or biking distance. I agree that it is a good idea to make choices to do activities that are closer to my house so that I do not only waste gas driving, but I could use that time driving to meditate. Another factor that I really liked that the film focused on is the difference an individual can make. I liked that he kept introducing the image of the water droplet to show the affect a person can have. Through this I think the film does a really good job showing the importance of individual action.

The film "Being the Change" was extremely inspirational to me on an environmental and personal level. As a college student, still trying to navigate independence and figure things out, life can get so hectic when taking in consideration all of my priorities and values. Right now, I am juggling so many different things and recently my goals have been to simply make it through the day without falling apart. I worry about all these things for the sake of my future and career. I know many of us probably share the same stories and there are some who have it way harder than I do. Watching this film reminded me that there is more to life than that. I realized how self-absorbed I get into my future and the things stressing me on a daily basis. I really enjoyed seeing the people who lived at the Casa de Paz in Oakland and their values. The man featured said his happiness stems from serving others. That really stood out to me. Instead of relying on materialistic things to make him happy, his simple role to do what he can for others served as his fulfillment. It was really moving to see that community and the impacts they have not just on the environment, but on each other and themselves. The film did a phenomenal job of showing that making changes to reduce your carbon emissions can also improve your life in ways that go beyond saving the planet. I feel I gained more than just ways to reduce my carbon emissions, but a new outlook on life. One thing I am interested in is starting meditation. Hearing what it has done for Peter and the relationships in his life sounds like something I would want to implement into mine. I am also happy to have seen the lifestyle of someone who only emits ~ 2 metric tons of CO2 per year, which is what we should emit annually according to the 2015 Paris Accord. While his life does look a lot different from mine, I do not see it as a completely unrealistic lifestyle for myself. More importantly, they look just as happy and fulfilled, if not more, as someone who lives an average American lifestyle. I hope to use my main takeaways from this film and implement them into my own life so as to see the unanticipated improvements and benefits.

After watching the documentary, climate scientist Peter Kalmus has really inspired and even motivated me to start thinking about living an environmentally conscious life. I agree with you, the one thing that stuck out to me that I would like to try out is meditation. Meditation can really clear one’s mind and allow thoughts to be processed without feeling stressed or rushed, something that I might need especially in college when things can be so tough balancing school, health, work, etc. The documentary truly introduced itself well as a “New Kind of Documentary”. Rather than the usual alarmist or dark side of things type of documentary that we’re usually assigned, “Being the Change” contributes to the audience a more positive perspective of being an environmentally conscious person. We use a lot of excuses to not live a conscious life; cars are convenient for transport, we should travel and see the world, or meat is so delicious and are necessary sources of protein. These are things that can be taken care of with a more friendly solution as seen with Kalmus. I think, as college students who are privileged to be educated on the climate crisis, we should try to live like Peter Kalmus and his wonderful family who do not complain or sway away from this type of lifestyle. Even though he wanted another child, he decided not to because of the growing global population. And while he is just one person in a country of over 300 million, he recognizes how much of a negative impact he can still contribute to the climate crisis. I also resonate with you about gaining a new perspective of life besides just reducing my carbon footprint. If producing around 2 metric tons of carbon a year can lead to happiness in my life, I would, without a doubt, adopt that lifestyle not just for me, but for the crisis.

I completely relate to this comment. I find myself constantly overwhelmed by just doing the bare minimum each day, and what I'm realizing is that maybe I'm putting my energy into the wrong goals.
         <br><br>
Like Peter said, our society has created this obsession with solving all our problems with technology and the 'myth of progress'. Like we talked about in lecture last week, this is coming from our capitalist society in the U.S.. Everyone is obsessed with working the longest and most productive hours every, day, week, month, year. Something that really resonated with my that Peter said in the film, 'Being the Change', was that the biosphere of earth requires balances and humans are certainly not above that, although our anthropocentric mindsets usually make it feel like we are. For some reason I think the 'American Dream' has changed over the years and used to symbolize empowerment, and freedom, but now has shifted to: 'humans can and should do whatever they want'. 
        <br><br>
At the beginning of the film Peter talks about how at first he was inspired by climate activists like Al Gore, but then realized if Al Gore, an expert on climate change, is telling people to switch their light bulbs and ix their leaky faucets...the temperature rise will never stop. These small personal changes are helpful, but what we need is a movement to create a complete cultural change. The problem with those small changes is that it only changes habits, it doesn't allow people to realize true happiness and peace in their lives. They will still be obsessed with process and pressured by the constant propaganda in our society. Somewhat contrasty, not every person needs to be as extreme in their activism or changes, there can be a gradual shift and a 'middle path' as Peter explained his earthy lifestyle compared to his neighbors expensive solar panels and heating system. 
        <br><br>
I love how you mention the inspiration  and 'new outlook on life' you felt from watching this film, because I agree! I was so happy to see their family riding bikes together, and going to play music at a vegan restaurant and the whole family practicing meditation. It's important that they included the aspects of their lives that were 'improved' and how they found peace while also reducing carbon emissions. Towards the end something that really stuck with me also was to try and 'make one positive change a week'. If people begin to reduce their emissions and they share that with other and spread the word, then hopefully the rest of society will catch on and start making one small change a week, and the end goal can be that we all demand changes from our leaders.



<br><hr>
I agree that it seems hard to think of our lives and how we fit into the big picture when the only way that we perceive it is with us as the main character. I thought it was interesting that they all practiced meditation, which I think aids in the practice of living consciously and responsibly. I also found it inspiring to see a real world application of the solutions we have been learning about for the last couple weeks. He also touches on the idea of supply and demand when talking about how to limit the number of planes that fly, and the potential power that individual action could have on changing the way things work. As a whole, this film was a success largely in the fact that he was so honest with us. This isn't someone trying to sell theoreticals, it was a genuine solution to a problem we should all be aware of. I will be sending this film to my family as a recommendation of how to possibly make some changes.

I can definitely 100% relate with your statement. It is so easy to feel as if we are the main characters of our lives. Sadly to say, but it almost feels like everyday is the same stressful cycle. We get up, we work, we go to class, we work on achieving and chasing (sometimes meaningless) goals, and go to bed. When does the cycle end? 
        <br><br>
Im really glad that you pulled out that scene from the film. It was so inspirational and awe-inspiring to hear of someone putting their time and effort into something that didn't have to do with only themselves. One of the main ideas that I loved about this film was that it doesn't only talk about how to change your carbon footprint. I think the film also does a great job at narrowing down a particular lifestyle that is not only emotionally beneficial, but amazing for the planet. If we all became a step more "environmentally conscious", I feel as if it could leave everlasting effects on our mental health as well as the earth. When we start to learn  love for the earth, I believe can have several effects such as more states of well-being that can inspire love for each other and increased human connection/empathy. Just like in the movie, communities that practice this love for the earth have people who are thriving off taking care of others first. 
        <br><br>
I was very inspired by the act of meditation in the movie, as I have heard/seen great things. I have recently started meditation, and have created myself a more mindful state in nature/my environment. It is so crazy to think that our campus is right next to a beach, but we never have time in our busy days to visit! I think its very important to give students more education on the beautiful wildlife around us, and how we are destroying it everyday.

The documentary “Being the Change” shows a simple life style of an American family with only one tenth the carbon foot print of the average annual emission of American people. Although this kind of life style might seems inconvenient and primitive, I actually like this kind of life. When I was a child, one of my dream career is being a fisherman. Even now I hope I could do it when I am retired. Except living in cities instead of near ocean, the film pictures a life that I dreamed of in childhood. Many people might says that this kind of live is really boring and dull, but in fact it might make people feel happier and more relaxed.

        <br><br>

Today our world is full with an amount of different things. All the fashion products and advanced technology shown on media have made us pursue material lives. They create a value that a life full of products and materials is the only way to make you happy. With this kind of value, many people become more and more fickle and peacockish. They thought that they could live better lives through having more things. Sometimes these things do make them happy and joyful, but more often, they could make their life more stressed and burdened. When people become more materialistic, they will feel more anxieties and stresses. This is because they would always want more to fulfill their desire, but their desires are unlimited. Once them have gotten what they wanted, they will always want more. So they will never be satisfied and happy but angry and gloomy.

        <br><br>

However, living a simple life like Peter, it could not only reduce global emission but also could improve our happiness. Because Peter and his friends have chosen to live simpler lives, many of the worries and stress will be left behind because they don’t have to care about so many things. They could do many meaningful things, like planting their own food and trees, modifying cars in order to limit emission, meditation and etc. All these can improve their physical and mental health.

In response to you, I do not like the inconvenient and primitive lifestyle displayed in “Being the change.” When talking about how boring and dull this lifestyle may be, that is exactly what I would say. I can’t imagine having to live that way for a week, let alone my entire lifetime. I would find that lifestyle pathetic and a waste of precious time. I don’t mean to knock your dreams, I just don’t see me and a fisherman living a very happy life together. 
        <br><br>

I think the claim made that if you live a life like Peter, you will not only reduce carbon emission but also be happier, is a bit far fetched. 
        <br><br>

One question that was brought up in Professor Ken’s introduction to “Being the Change,” was whether it was possible for someone to even live sustainably in the United States. He then went on to say that this would mean reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1/10 of what they are now. If an individual could, he begins to question if an entire family could live this lifestyle? In the movie it was discussed how though the main character’s carbon emission was less than other Americans, it was still far greater than anyone in Bangladesh and animals. This got me thinking- how are the people living in Bangladesh? They are clearly not living the same exciting, full of life and fun lifestyle I want to be living.

“Being the Change” is an interesting and very informative film. Peter distinguishes different methods on how to reduce gas emissions and distinguishes the problems that we are facing.It is very encouraging that we can still make a difference and ways to reduce climate change. Peter’s lifestyle is an example of how to live simply and being happy. It is encouraging how his whole family is an example of the 1/10 average of gas emits which inspired me that it is possible. He gives very good information on ways to reduce the gas emissions, but also it would be very challenging to not have a car. I feel like riding a bike everywhere especially with young children would be overbearing. Peter also distinguishes that there are also different kinds of transportations like the bus or train to have another option besides cycling. This movie made me reflect my own life and what ways or methods I can do to reduce my gas emissions. I can buy less clothes and start using my bike more often. In addition, this made me have a big house and open my eyes without  being materialistic. Since the society continues to portray that in order to look and be successful, you need the newest  products and big houses. This allowed me to understand wherever you are and what you do in life is your own happiness and success.

I agree with you Mariah. It was certainly encouraging to see Peter's perspective on how we can mitigate the climate crisis in our everyday lives. One aspect that I found super interesting that both Ken and Peter emphasize, is the fact that once people start to reduce their carbon footprint by not playing into consumerism- they become happier. I really stand by this point. I know in my own life that I try to keep my material items to a minimum and only keep the objects I really need. In addition to that, I always try to make environmentally conscious decisions when I.T. comes to food and transportation. I find myself happier when I know I am making a positive impact on the environment. That impact does not only effect but also the rest of society.
        <br><br>
Overall, I hope that this film "Being the Change" can motivate other people to start changing different aspects of their life. I think that If society collectively shifts their perspective on what living "a happy life means", the earth would be a happier and less polluted place.



<br><Hr>
I also think this film is very inspiring. After watching many films about global warming, I would say I felt under pressure and hopeless from most of them, but this one brings a positive attitude to me. This film shows the way that Kalmus and his family are living, they lived a happy low-carbon life. It is impressive to me that Kalmus cut his fossil fuel use to 1/10th of the average American, it is not an easy thing to do. He also discussed food growing, bicycling, and mediation, and I think these are good ways to makes changes. I used to think that change one’s lifestyle is something troublesome to do, that it will definitely cause a lot of inconveniences, and I won’t live happily, but after seeing what Kalmus is doing, it changes my opinion, it is not a hard thing to do at all. His airplane example is very persuasive, he says that "If you decide not to fly, and the plane goes with an empty seat, it is true, it is almost the same amount of emissions. If 300 people decide not to fly, then they fly one less plane, and there are fewer emissions. If 3,000 people decide not to fly, then they fly 10 fewer planes and there are much fewer emissions.” We can all change our minds and lifestyles and live happily, and that if we all work together, we can build a bright future.

This film conveys an idea that there are many things we can do in our daily life to be more environmental friendly. In this film, Peter Kalmus shows  how people can reduce emitting fossil fuels and help the crisis of climate change. He also shows environmental friendly lifestyles. For example, Peter Kalmus shows audience how to reduced his carbon footprint by 1/10th, such as ride bike to work instead of driving cars, using waste veggie oil for cars, building solar panels and solar water heaters, having grassroots shifts.
        <br><br>


I think most of the film’s audiences are already concerned about the issue. As the environmental problem is a serious and popular issue in global. Every person already have the awareness of environment protection and gradually take actions in their daily life like classifying rubbish and recycled utilization. 
        <br><br>


I feel really optimistic and hopeful to the future after watching this film. Different from other films which talking about how terrible the environmental situation currently is and how badly consequences it will lead to in the future, this film talk about environmental problem from different perspective. It conveys audiences an idea that there are many people working on making environment better and there are more things people can do to contribute an effort.
        <br><br>


Watching this film i learned that one person to put in effort for our environment would bring more and more people to care  about environment and put in effort. Although the effort an individual person put in environmental protection is just like a drop in sea which is a very small action, a large amount of people put in effort will make a visible change on environment.

I appreciated the way Peter demonstrated how people can change their habits to minimize their effects on climate change. Instead of just talking about it he showed what he actually did differently, which I believe goes a long way with people. I couldn't believe he actually reduced his carbon footprint to 1/10, and powered his car with veggie oil. 
        <br><br>


I feel optimistic for our future as well. Everyone, whether they like it or not are going to have to change their lifestyles dramatically, and Peter gives a glimpse as to how that might be. It does seem like a drop in the sea but they all add up.

Honestly I think this is a bad example of a 'sustainable' lifestyle. The major reduction to his carbon footprint was from flying. Although I admire his commitment in reducing his air miles, he simply substituted it with his grease powered car. Although this is commendable, it is not reproducible in a large scale. In the film we see him hit multiple restaurants for their waste oil. This means that if even two or three people around him wanted to do the same, they would have to share that oil and he would be unable to complete his long trips based solely on oil. As such, his lifestyle, although sustainable for him is not an example to be followed by others. In reality, he found a way to sustainably maintain his relatively lavish lifestyle by leeching off the over consumption of others. If everyone were to adopt a plant based diet, then there would not be so much left over oil for his car. Eventually, if he wishes to continue on his green path, he will have to switch to bus or train travel.

Being the Change 
         <br><br>
The movie records Peter’s journey of reducing his carbon footprint, it is a documentary about how ordinary people trying to live more sustainable to better serve the environment. While watching the movie, there are some questions constantly exist: is that enough for the current climate crisis? If not, what should ordinary people do to improve? What are all the difficulties, etc. We have been discussing plenty problems based on the main topic, which is the climate crisis in this class. People do need face this crisis and try to prevent further damages to the environment. The movie was a bit dull at the beginning but since it features ordinary people and their life, there were many good advices and references that we could apply into our lives. I am also inspired by the minimalistic lifestyle that widely promoting through the globe, which indicates that people are trying to minimalize their consumption for a better future.

<p>
I think that the film "Tomorrow" did a great job of acknowledging the environmental crisis we are in while promoting and giving solutions to these issues. It described ways in which we could better reinvent our agriculture, energy, economic, democratic, and education systems that would support the people and local communities over big corporations. I appreciated how this film recognized that many people ranging from economists, environmentalists, educators, business owners, and politicians all agreed that there are better systems to follow for the people and the environment, and that creating a better system for the environment benefits the people. This film provided solutions at a local level and recognized that we can create change within our local communities, thus having an effect on a wider scale. I enjoyed all aspects of this film and would highly encourage my friends and family to watch it as well. It did a very good job of acknowledging that we need change, while providing solutions on how to make a difference.
         <br><br>

Additionally, I think that the film “Being the Change” showed people that ordinary people, such as Peter Kalmus, can make changes to their lifestyle in order to help reduce their carbon footprint. I think that Peter did a good job of highlighting how all of the environmental changes he has made in his life has made him an overall happier person. The film also does a good job of describing how the society we live in thinks happiness comes from materialistic things and economic gain.

I really liked your analysis of the film "Tomorrow." Rather than alarming its audience of the consequences of the climate crisis, the film did an intricate review of numerous solutions on a local level enacted by your average American. Because of this, it seems that the film was able to reach the audience in a more positive light regarding the climate crisis and that every one of us is capable of evoking change against this global problem. I personally thought that this movie excellently communicated an optimistic position. While we are still not at the level of health our planet should be at, films such as "Tomorrow" are a good source of helpful, useful information that actually does sound achievable. It gives us this sense of hope that we will be able to veer our dependence away from fossil fuels and of all the benefits that could be experienced if communities more heavily depended on public transportation, participated in community garden--things that, like Ken said, can spark happiness in more people by joining them together through a common ideal.

I liked many of the ideas presented in this video. La Casa de Paz seemed like an interesting way of living and reminded me of the hippies. On the other hand, I didn’t really understand humanure in a first world context. It disinfects your poop to use as manure, but many people, especially those living in the city, don’t have gardens or fields. I liked the reuse and repair conventions the other community had. I always think it is a waste to just throw things out immediately, but sometimes I don’t have the skills to fix my appliances. It would also be nice to have people with experience sew my clothes back together when they fall apart so I don’t have to throw any away when they become unusable.

Kalmus is an extremely intelligent and well-spoken advocate for climate change, he genuinely cares about making changes that benefit every living being on Earth. I liked this film the tone was much lighter and positive than the other which we watched. Although it still highlighted the imminent threat of climate change and the pressing need for change, it did not leave me feeling helpless or insignificant after watching it. I instead was left feeling inspired and filled with a sense of purpose, like the small things I do actually matter and can create change. 
         <br><br>

I think many people feel that to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle is very difficult and leaves one feeling very unsatisfied, however, Peter and his family prove that you don't need to be super rich or make huge sacrifices to be kinder to the planet. Another great point this film makes is that small actions performed by individuals add up very quickly to nationwide change, you don't have to go as far as Peter and drive a car that runs on oil or dumpster dive for food, simply going vegetarian, riding a bike, decreasing the amount you fly, etc. all have huge impacts when a large amount of people make these switches. 
         <br><br>

Peter is a climate scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and has a degree from CalTech so you know he knows what he's talking about. He also is using his brain and his energy to advocate for climate change when he could be making millions working for some huge tech company or something so that shows you he's passionate about what he's talking about in the film. Not to mention, the man-made a car that runs on vegetable oil, rides a bike almost everywhere, doesn't fly anymore, composts with humanure, eats food that would've otherwise been wasted, the list goes on and on. Bottom line, Peter Kalmus is aware of what is at stake in the climate crisis, wants to educate others about it, and has changed his whole lifestyle because of it.

I found one of the words Peter wrote on his arm "equanimity" as very profound. On the surface, equanimity talks about integrity, about stoicism, about being not too high nor too low. I think this concept has been lost in modern societies. It seems like we are living in a world of extremes. Everything is about consumption, wether it's food or objects or content on the internet. People rarely just have time to just be empty and calm for a bit, self-reflect.
         <br><br>

I think this results in the mindsets we have as a species right now, with bigger and more is better. People are constantly searching for those highs, they are never happy, and always feel they need to exhibit their prosperity in some way or another. If people were more equanimous, then these notions would soon vanish.
         <br><br>

When I first moved to America i felt pretty alone, and there was this book that i started reading, Norman Vincent Peale's "The power of positive thinking". I wasn't expecting it to be a religious book but it talked a lot about god and spiritualism in general. I started praying everyday for 5 minutes, nothing in particular, just talking in my head, putting positive and thankful thoughts in my brain. Slowly this morphed into a daily habit, and I try to meditate each morning, while often I go to the beach for my 10-15 minutes of mindfulness.
         <br><br>

This is where society needs to start. By being more mindful, equanimous and stoic, then doing the right thing would be an obvious result.

Hi, I find your statement regarding equanimity being "very profound" interesting to me. Equanimity is being mentally calm in difficult situations. The author embarks a journey and cuts down on his own climate impact to under a tenth of America's average and ultimately finds happiness. He challenges societies' love with technology and its presumption that it will one day save us. He enlists ways to reduce carbon emissions that are effective  If you are reducing emissions, you should let the people around you and the world to know about it. This kind of lifestyle is only taken upon within a few percentage of the population. To create a massive change, we need to require huge shifts in energy usage.

Quite a special film about climate change, the author of Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution pays attention to individual actions under global warming. Peter Kalmus, first heard about global warming in the sixth grade, has been more aware of the serious global situation and decided to take action since he became the father of two children. 
         <br><br>
I think that this film is more likely to be a “vlog” about the author’s personal life than a documentary. However, following with the pace of the filmmaker, I was influenced a lot, as if being placed in Peter’s life, that I should also do something in my daily life to make a difference. There is a metaphor in the film which benefits me a lot: one person’s effort likes a drop of water; if everyone contributes their strength, then a huge ocean will be created. 
         <br><br>
The “Head-Hand-Heart” system mentioned in both this film and Peter’s book impressed me deeply: intellectual understanding, practically doing stuff, and ties everything together(combine thinking and actions) to find real meaning and get a satisfying life. In this film, Peter tries to get a relatively natural lifestyle: plant trees, raise bees, cherish food, set up repair clubs, and drive grease powered cars. In my opinion, it is not only a simple record of Peter’s own life but also a description of worth-learning and an environmentally friendly lifestyle.
         <br><br>
By meditating, the filmmaker learned not to wreak negative emotions to others nor feel despairing about the world. I did meditate in my life which helps me a lot. I like to stay along in the silent night and get relaxed, leave the brain blank for a while, and think about the past, the present, and the near future. In today’s busy life, it is quite difficult to calm down and adjust ourselves. But meditation indeed helps me to achieve it. 
         <br><br>
However, just as I mentioned before, this film is more likely to be a vlog about the filmmaker’s life. By listing too many things without a rigorous order, the filmmaker just blurs the main idea a little bit. Moreover, the filmmaker just shows some specific ways to change lifestyle without explaining the cause and effect. (But these are explained in Peter’s book, which is worth reading.)
         <br><br>
In general, this film successfully appeals to people to become environmental awareness and take action to save the world.

Hi there thank you for sharing and I completely agree with your comment! I also found the film was a bit difficult to follow and somewhat structure that I was a bit confused especially at the beginning of the film that I did not really know where this film was going. Despite these minor imperfections, Being the Change is nevertheless a great film in attracting people's attention to the issue of climate change and showing them good examples to follow in their daily lives to reduce their carbon footprint. With this interest in knowing more about climate change which this documentary helped to spark, the audience can then progress to have a more thorough and comprehensive understanding of the climate crisis and to learn to adopt different personal actions in their lives to reduce their personal carbon emission into the atmosphere in order to mitigate the climate crisis. 
         <br><br>
I also agree with your comment on meditation that even though this may not be super relevant to the climate crisis, meditation is still a very useful tool to help us relax and destress especially in the fast-paced world that we live in today and under which we can become stressed and pressure so easily. I have been learning to meditate everyday and this is helping me to learn to calm down and control my quick temper and to become into a more balanced calm person. 
         <br><br>
All in all, the Kalmus family has established a good example for many others to follow in terms of incorporating climate-conscious actions into our everyday life. Together, our actions will hopefully bring climate change to a halt and our future will not be in such a grim, doomed state.

I think Peter is someone I would really look up to if I knew him personally in life. He is passionate about one thing and has been persevered putting actions into it for ten years. I extremely respect him for bringing up “head, hand, and heart” in his book, with head standing for the intelligence or understanding for the climate science, hand meaning putting in effort and providing opportunities for people to do so, and heart representing the emotional connection between the head and hand, which helps you find meanings and values of doing and understanding such things. 

         <br><br>

Another thing that captured my attention was meditation. Peter’s voice of explaining the meaning of meditation reminded me of the guiding voice in the meditation app called Headspace. I found myself feeling a little regretting and shameful because I downloaded this app called Headspace last month and I wanted to keep a ten minute meditation as a daily habit, but I only did that for three days and I never opened that app ever since. Ten minutes of meditation, which is such a small amount comparing to the two hours per day for Peter in the film, but I couldn’t even keep doing that for a week. I have read a lot about meditation and knew that it was part of a serene and calming lifestyle that can help us to reflect upon our life and experience time and feelings in an extremely peaceful way. I really think that meditation can sweep out the anxiety and depression and all the other negative feelings and that’s crucial in changing people’s way of living and our culture.

         <br><br>

The way the film is narrated also gives me a specific picture of a sustainable lifestyle every family is able to live in. It was hard for me to picture such experience on a daily basis before watching it, but now it gives me a sense of how personal actions can be carried out in our lives.

I also really respect Peter because he is not only talking about how things must be changed to save the planet, but is taking action as well by completely transforming his lifestyle to reduce his carbon footprint. It is one thing to say that things must be done, but another to actually live by those words. His involvement in scientific research, personal lifestyle changes, and organized activism, which is all to contribute to combating the climate crisis, is quite commendable.
         <br><br>
I have also tried meditation through an app years ago, but I stopped shortly after as well. But, I don’t think that it is something to feel ashamed of. Even if it provides positive results for people like Peter, I don’t think that everyone should meditate just because it works and has some benefits, especially if you have already tried doing so.
         <br><br>
This film does show how a more sustainable lifestyle can be implemented for a lot of people in America. Peter has a family, a job, and lives in a suburban area, but is still able to stray away from the typical fossil fuel heavy “necessities” that come with that life. If he can do it, so can many others in a similar situation. And like he emphasizes, a lifestyle that helps the environment will not come at a personal cost, as these actions can become easy, normal, and help provide meaning to peoples’ lives.

For me, “Being the Change” is a really fascinating documentary, and it mainly talks about how personal actions can involve in the protection of the environment and encourages people to change their lifestyles to be more environmentally friendly. This movie lets me understand how powerful these little actions can be in the process of saving the earth and make a difference. This documentary is about a man named Peter and how his actions reduced his emissions to 1/10th of the average American. His actions show us the ideal solutions for what actions we can also take in our life to reduce daily emissions.

I also think "Being the Change" was interesting because it depicted an average day in the life of someone who is very environmentally aware. It was a really easy-to-follow film as it was very chronological and casual. Because of this, I felt even more motivation to replicate his lifestyle as he did it so effortlessly and presented it so simply. His ways are initially really extreme compared to what I'm used to, but it is people like him who can inspire others to think outside the box to help the environment. This documentary was very good at relating to the audience as it presented an average family of two parents and two children who go about their lives being conscious of the environment. It is inspirational as it makes it seem like it is also possible for everyone else to replicate the same lifestyle.

The film attempts to share positive, new ideas of how the world should function economically, socially, and politically. The film follows different systems set up around the world and explains their uniqueness and advantages. Some ideas are controversial and I personally am not appealed to them.
         <br><br>

 The idea of having a currency to benefit small businesses seems overly-complicated and unnecessary. The same benefit can be achieved by sponsoring pro-small business propaganda and subsidizing them. The multiple currency for one area does not seem like it would be an idea easily integrated in the US. And other than slightly inconveniencing large corporations, there seems to be little environmental impact to this legislation.
         <br><br>

One aspect I did enjoy watching was the democratic transition in Iceland. As a political science major, it is nice to see the power transition from a small elite to the people. It was inspiring to see protests end in a beneficial result. It gives me hope for the rest of the seemingly endless protests around the world. This was a common theme throughout this film. The film shows positive change, hopefully to inspire their audience to look and fight for a better future. This is a nice change of pace from the tear inducing films we’ve been watching as a class. 
         <br><br>

This film also mentions the problems of the mono-agriculture of today. This is a major problem that can encourage disease, food shortages, and crop failures. This can be combated through smaller, more diverse farms. This is also mentioned in Carson’s Silent Spring. It’s incredibly satisfying to watch the information we’ve been learning come together interlap with each film or reading.
         <br><br>

One particular aspect of the film I wasn’t a fan of was when the environment was compared to the economy. I felt like the two, despite similarities were not comparable. Each had their different issues facing them and the metaphor did not work in the film. I also felt like the focus on the economy was outside of the spoke of our class.

The film "Being the change" mainly focuses on reducing the impact of human activities to the climate change. It explains that climate change is threatening both physical and metal health; air pollution is harmful for people’s respiratory system and polluted environment cause higher possibility of getting depression. I feel the film is persuasive because it shows a lot of examples on environment protection and appeals to the public to participate. 
         <br><br>
As realizing our daily actions to the contribution of global warming, the director did a series of changes to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. For instance, he leads his family to ride bikes as daily transportation instead of driving. Riding bike does not produce greenhouse gases and it is a good exercise. The director also drives for long distance instead of taking a flight. He uses vegetable oil as the car fuel to reduce emission into the air. He plants trees in his garden; he grows fresh vegetables and sells to the neighbors in low price. Also, the director visits some environmentalists, showing us other methods of consuming energy in a more efficient way such as utilizing solar energy to create electricity. Moreover, the director emphasizes the audience to reduce the waste because the wastes including foods and plastics are bringing heavy burden to the planet to decompose these waste, and greenhouse gases are emitted during decomposition. As a result, the director brings a suggestion which gives these wastes a home by reusing them. For example, he uses some old newspaper to create a cloth. I found that more professional way is to bring the wastes into the ecologic cycle which naturally does. The director is making small changes that contributes to save the planet. I believe he is making the film appealing that everybody needs to participate in the action of protecting the environment.

I agree with you. This film talks about the climate crisis but in a different way. This film explores this problem through individual effort, which is more effective than just talking about the existence of the crisis. In the film, Peter Kalmus cut his fossil fuel use to 1/10th of the average American by reducing the use of cars and airplanes. And, his friends also contribute their efforts like the application of solar panel and collection from the food waste. Peter points out that everyone can do something for the climate crisis. For example, artists make art about it, musicians make music about it, and writers write about it. As the movie said, the individual work is just the little drop that can't change the world enormously, but as the drops are cumulated together the world can be changed. Besides, one point in the film inspires me that "global warming is the result of wanting more". Nowadays, people always want to catch up on the latest fashion, like new iPhones, cameras, and cars, causing tones of waste. This kind of thinking is like the virus that spread easily, leading to an endless negative loop to the climate. And what they did in the film, the free repairing shop, is very good to break this circle. We have to use our action to influence the people surrounding to change their mind. We should make effective use as proud rather than chasing the latest product irrationally.

The film “Being The Change” shows us the lifestyle of a climate activist, Peter Kalmus. Kalmus shows us how he has significantly decreased his personal carbon footprint along with his family, consisting of his wife and two kids. Not only has Kalmus decreased his carbon footprint, but he has also increased his happiness. He simply explains how he has done this with his concept of head, hands, and heart. The “head” part means that you have read about climate change and understand the seriousness of it. The “hands” part means that you have begun to take action in order to combat climate change. The “heart” part has to do with finding meaning and happiness with all of the things that you have been doing. Even though Kalmus has made this change to seem simple, it is a change that requires a lot of will and passion. There are some things that he does that I could see myself doing, such as less or no flying on airplanes and gardening. There are other things that he does that I could not see myself doing, such as getting food that is thrown away by supermarkets and his whole bathroom set up. 
          <br><br>
Throughout the film, Kalmus shows us and introduces us to his friends that are also passionate about being more environmentally friendly. It is interesting how each of them focus more on different things but what they all share in common is that they are motivated to fight the climate crisis. All these activists have their own reasons that motivate them, and in the film we find out Kalmus’ reason. He tells us in the beginning that the birth of his children is what really motivated him to begin changing. I guess we just all need that huge motivating reason to start changing.

I didn't think much of the head, hands, and heart approach when it was presented to be in the film, but reading your explanation I am beginning to appreciate it a bit more. It puts a reason to why I haven't quite been able to fully commit to my desire to engage in being an environmentalist- I've only been doing the head, and forgetting the hands and heart. The heart I believe will come easily, but the hands I will need to seek out and I'm not quite sure how to do that in a busy place like college.
          <br><br>
I also enjoyed Peter's introductions to his environmentally-motivated friends and his suggestion to try to meet people with these similar ideas. It resonated with me the most because we're all educated so much by the people around us (whether we realize it or not) and these people can either inspire positive change or allow us to plateau. Moving into college, I was fortunate to end up roommates with one environmentally-educated individual, and close friends with another, whom through open discussions inspired me to learn more about the topic. They're a large part of the reason I took Ken's class actually, and through this class I've been inspired to dig deeper and potentially join the UCSB environmental affairs board and make lifestyle changes as well.

One quote that stuck with me from the film “Being the Change” was “people who do more environmentally friendly things are happier. They’ve got more meaning in their life.”
           <br><br>

            The message that the more stuff we have, the unhappier we get continues to be brought up. And I genuinely think that by taking simple actions like downsizing your house and growing your own food can lead to a happier lifestyle. Peter is able to live a happy life by being environmentally friendly; he even drives a car named “Maeby” fueled by grease from local restaurants to prevent using gasoline. When you know you are doing something positive for the environment, it will instantly make you feel happier knowing you are doing your part. Watching a suburban family live minimally and environmentally friendly gives hope that others can do the same. I think it is very important for my generation to raise our kids to take care of the environment because if the following generations can live minimally with less food waste and materialistic goods, they can live much happier like Peter’s family.

That quote was also one of my favorites. It reminded me a lot of the themes from "Minimalism". Based on how Peter lives, it seems that this quote is also very true. He is able to live a happy life with his family, yet he only emits 2 tons of CO2 per year, which is 1/10 of the average American. You can tell that he is happy with the changes he has made in order to be more environmentally friendly. 
           <br><br>

Along with this, I believe this film helped show his audience that environmentally-friendly actions can be done over a stretch of time. In the film, it shows Peter go from emitting 20 tons of CO2 to 2 tons, all just from little changes he made over time. Obviously, most people won't run their cars off of left of grease, but it at least visualizes the change that one can make, while still living a.happy and satisfying life.


<br><hr>
The movie being the change mentions that we need to take action, not just verbally to reduce carbon emissions and control climate change. The protagonists do the same. Peter use cars with almost no carbon emissions, use candles instead of electric lights, make more contributions to the community, and introduce the impact of climate change and solutions to other neighbors which I also agree is really helpful to protect the environment. The article also mentioned a lot of carbon emissions and climate impact caused by the emergence of airplanes, as well as the previous reading, which also called for people to reduce air travel. Ken also mentioned that we can contribute to the environment through small details of life. For example, use more plant based diets. I always agree with the idea of taking less cars and eating less beef. However, I agree that reducing air travel is a very effective way to reduce carbon emissions, but I also think it is difficult to do so. Because in the case of long-distance travel and time constraints, the choice of aircraft is inevitable. The situation doesn't give us special treatment because I want to protect the environment. If this happens more frequently, the number of flights cannot be reduced. So I agree to protect the climate and environment from the things around us, but I don't think there are many things that we haven't had the chance to do for the time being.

That quote also resonated with me. I felt pretty lost during the documentary and felt that it was poorly made in the sense of having no real storyline. However when that quote was said I felt like the purpose of the film became more apparent: that living in a more harmonious way with the environment makes us feel happier.
           <br><br>
This movie was arguably the least informative of the those we've had to watch for this class, but ended up leaving one of the biggest impacts on my mentality. Something in me really contemplated the portion when the female professor explained intrinsic motivations: essentially how doing the right thing that aligns with your morals ends up making you feel good. After being resistant to what I considered to be over the top lifestyle changes that were inherently futile when comparing their impact to the magnitude of the issue, that simple quote that some would consider cheesy really made me stop the internet dialogue that was resisting his efforts. The logic is simple: happiness triumphs every other need. If his lifestyle makes him happy even if it is tedious for him, then its not over the top or silly. As someone who comes from a well off background who is lucky to have many things to look forward to and a good health, I still find myself stressed and unhappy at many times. What's the point of continuing my inherently domination based lifestyle if I still feel at unease or unhappy with myself? That simple message prevailed me to by the end of the movie. It's subtle in its nature and the emphasis on meditation and spiritual things will, in my opinion, dissuade many people from understanding this. As an example: I watched this with my girlfriend and at the end she felt as though the movie was a waste of time. Not everyone will see the underlying message, but that quote helped me.




<br><hr>


When watching this film and looking at that quote I couldn't help but think back to Thoreau. When reading Thoreau I believe most people saw him as an extreme example of minimalism and sustainability but we can all agree on his overall message of living a less materialistic life. I also believe that Peter is a slightly extreme example of someone who lives an overly materialistic life. While I completely respect his lifestyle choices , Ken has said over and over that the most important thing we can do is vote and believe in these policy changes. Thoreau and Peter have both inspired me to live a life that is less dominated by materialism i.e. not obsessing over buying new things and relying on the happiness that it gives me, but I highly doubt I will ever make a huge lifestyle choice change to the point where I go dumpster diving for my food or use a car fueled by grease. While these are sustainable choices, there are better ways of voicing your opinions like voting and living slightly more sustainable lives through eating less meat or taking more public transport. For the future generations, I don't believe we need to teach them to completely give up eating all meat or driving grease fueled cars, but we need to pass down the value of living a simple life.

That quote was also one that stuck out to me. As soon as he said that quote I had a realization that maybe I would be happier if I got rid of all of these possessions that really have no meaning for me. I remember that one of the main lessons in my elementary school gardening class was that one can feel immense pride and happiness when they eat the things that they planted and cultivated. I feel like this can be applied to everyone’s life in that everyone should give gardening, sewing, building, or repairing a shot because the end product will always be something that you will be proud of. I have to salute Peter for making a change in every aspect of his life and dedicate his life to leaving behind a planet that his kids and his kids’ kids can enjoy as much as he has. Peter also gives me immense hope that there are ways to reduce your carbon footprint without giving up much of anything, he lives just as much of a ‘normal’ life as his peers. I was also amazed to see what a stress-free and happy life that Peter and his family live. After watching this documentary, I am more confident that I will be able to make changes in my lifestyle.




<br><hr>

I think it’s interesting that you bring up this quote because it ties in well with themes that we have discussed in the past about our consumerist culture and happiness. I’ve been thinking about this idea a lot more since it was introduced in this class. In the back of my mind I've always known that stuff wouldn’t make me truly happy, but I was never even considering the environment. Now that I see that one, it won’t make me happier and two, it can help me do my part in this climate crisis, I don’t see why I shouldn’t be trying to make these lifestyle changes. In the small amount of time that I’ve decided to actively stop shopping online and cutting my red meat intake (even though I already don’t eat beef), I’ve noticed that doing this hasn’t made me less happy. I will say, I don’t think that I see an increase in my happiness, but I definitely don’t see a decrease in my level of happiness. Watching Peter live a more environmentally conscious lifestyle gives me hope that others in our generation will consider making lifestyle changes, and introducing this new lifestyle to our kids in order to take care of this earth.




<br><hr>

This quote definitely stood out to me as well. Like we have seen in the past, in films like "Minimalism", simpler lives seems to lead to happier lives.
           <br><br>


Before entering this class, I (like many others today) had the misconception that "downgrading" to a more minimalist lifestyle like Peter would not be possible. I thought that first-world societies like the USA were too dependent on lavish lifestyles - buying big homes, driving expensive cars, etc - and it had been too ingrained in our culture to fallback to simpler, and more environmentally friendly lifestyle.  
           <br><br>


However, after watching "Being the Change" and "Minimalism", I can now see that moving to simpler and more efficient lifestyles does not actually have to be a fallback; in many cases it is a upgrade. As you mentioned, the suburban family living minimally and environmentally friendly lives while being happy can be used as a model to motivate people across the world to do the same. Moving, forward it is important to remove the negative stigma behind living simpler lives and ingrain this mindset in both our generation and our kids' generation. 
           <br><br>


If our generation and future generations want to make a real impact in trying to curb climate change, we will need a major culture shift across the world. It is our responsibility to help move society away from the dependency and the praise of environmentally harmful lifestyles

The film Tomorrow (Demain) is a thought provoking and universalizing take on climate change. In a clear and concise way, the film lists a myriad of ways for the average individual to get involved and make a change. Demain is a foreign film and instills hope in its watchers-- climate change must be a global undertaking. Watching these activists only creates momentum for the rest of the world to follow. Personally, what made the film so poignant is the effort to rewire climate change as a negative situation into one of hope and optimism. So many people are dismayed at how far we have to go and the slow process of changing our fossil fuel dependence, when in reality, small changes do matter, examples throughout the movie such as Detroit’s garden initiative and Copenhagen’s reduction on carbon dioxide transportation only solidify the message that small actions on an individual level culminates in tangible change. This film does a great job showcasing the small but detrimental impact climate change is having on communities. While it seems very possible, the main concern is convincing people to transition. The tipping point is soon whether it is in the next 20 years or even tomorrow, nothing is guaranteed and we must all do whatever we can to help.

I completely agree with your impeccable analysis of the movie Tomorrow (Demain). Instead of alarming its audience of the doom that is to come due to climate change, this movie explored many creative solutions to the climate crisis that were enacted by normal people. By doing this, the movie was able to convey optimism in regard to solving the climate crisis, in comparison to the pessimism that can often be seen in alarmist articles. Thus, I believe this movie did a great job in communicating solutions to the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
We are still a long ways away from where we need to be in terms of starting to save the planet, but movies like these give light to a better future that could result with the waning of the world's dependence on fossil fuels. Communities can be brought together through better public transportation, and community gardens that unite people through a common cause. Like Ken said, although a reduction in fossil fuel use may drain the economy, it could spark happiness in more people.


<br><hr>
After watching this film Tomorrow, I feel more optimistic than other films that watching before.
This film successfully conveys his subject: many different places and different
countries use different sustainable methods to protect environment. There are five
chapters in the film: agriculture, energy, economy, democracy and education. In the
beginning, this film talks about human physical needs like food and energy. Foods are
the outcomes of agriculture. Then, this film talks more deeper into our life and spirit.
So, the following chapter are economy, democracy and education.
In this film, the most impressed scene for me is that In Copenhagen, 60% of people do
not drive, but choose to ride a bicycle or take public transportation. I am from China.
Because of the large population in population, there are many cars, and exhaust
emissions from excessive vehicles can cause atmospheric pollution.
I think this film’s audience can be casual viewer. It is a good movie to teach everyone
how to have a sustainable life in order to protect the planet.
This film makes me most surprised clip is the last part of movie. It mentions that in
Finland, there are at least 2 teachers in one class who not only teach academic
knowledge, but also focus on social skills that related to climate change in order to
teach students how to eliminate the harm for the earth.
<br><hr>
I agree with you on how watching activists doing actual work and trying to promote change can greatly help in creating momentum towards encouraging people to make change. I think one of the problems with the climate change movement is how a lot of the messages are negative and show people what will happen if we don't fix the problems, instead of showing what could happen if we make change. I think a problem is that a lot of people think they will have to make massive changes in their lifestyles to fix climate change, but like you said, even small changes matter, and in my opinion making a change no matter how small it is, is better than no change.

There is a quote from a Macklemore song (don’t judge too quickly) that says “Don't try to change the world, find something that you love/And do it every day/Do that for the rest of your life/And eventually, the world will change.” This quote outlines this film perfectly in my opinion. 
           <br><br>
In the film, “Be the Change” the topic that stood out to me most is the role our hearts play in this issue. Peter Kalmus talks a lot about how important our hearts are to our investment in environmentalism and addressing climate change. In one part of the movie, Kalmus says “This is going to happen one heart at a time.” This further outlines the importance of caring in environmentalism. The heart ties everything together. “The heart is where you find meaning in this,” as Peter stated. If people care about things, then they will pursue them. As similarly stated in the lyric, the movie wants us to follow our hearts in order to help us dedicate ourselves to living more loving and sustainable lives. Also, Kalmus finds community at Citizen’s Climate Lobby. This lessens the weight that many environmentalists and just people who care have when thinking about the climate crisis. Knowing that there are other people out there who also care and are putting their individual, unique talents to work on the same issue is a heartwarming and world-changing thing. If everyone made some small contribution in their own unique way to the Earth and life on Earth, the world would be a better place. This outlines the part of the lyric that says “Don’t try to change the world” because that on its own is a terrifyingly daunting task. I have looked at that task and thought it was mine to face alone many times. It makes you lose hope when the issue is so large, but when it gets broken down, we can all take on that task together with much more ease. Twenty people carrying a piano is much easier than one.
           <br><br>

Peter also talks about the idea that we, as humans, have viewed technology and intelligence as reason and means to “do whatever we want and wreak havoc”. The idealization of technological innovation and technology’s role as the scale of human progress has skewed our outlook on life itself. We may live longer lives, but who’s to say that those lives have been any more meaningful or at all “better” than those of our predecessors? Our scale does not fit the subject. Life is so complex, but as Peter states, it’s also this extraordinary feat of balance. “The biosphere depends on balance… We are not above that basic law…” I think it’s really interesting that Peter Kalmus used to be a physicist and changed his path in life. This impacted me because it showed that people could change and people were willing to change. They’re willing to look away from the imaginary line of never-ending growth, and see the circle of life. This is where I have questions. How do we get people to care that much about the Earth? How do we get them to focus their goals on their hearts rather than their pockets? Why do some people care so much about the Earth whereas others don’t see the appeal? Where is the disconnect?

<p>
After watching the "Be the Change" film, one quote stood out most prominently to me. Peter Kalmus said that "wanting more has led to the climate crisis." Although rather simple, I believe this concept is what this course keeps coming back to again and again, especially when focusing on cultural change as a solution to this crisis. This quote leaves me wondering if wanting the biggest and most destructive toys society has to offer is strictly an American idea of a successful life or if this idea spans across the globe. Growing up in such an industrial society, I know no widespread alternative to this life based on consumerism and acquiring wealth. As this course continues, it has actually made me reflect upon the things I truly value most in life when it comes to material items and the desire for wealth. After all, did I really come to a prestigious university just for the idea of getting a degree and therefore a well paying job? I have found it important to create a balance in life as opposed to simply becoming a slave to the capitalist construct I find myself in. There is so much satisfaction and beauty in doing the simple things, it's far too easy to get lost and swept away when only focusing on the big material goals society overly emphasizes. Consequently, I like that Peter emphasized that his efforts likely won't resolve the climate crisis but that he feels he should at least try his best. In fact, he states that everyone choosing to ignore these climate warnings is exactly why we are in this predicament in the first place. Ultimately, I respect his lifestyle and I agree that anyone acting to reduce their climate impact, no matter how small or large, should be encouraged.

 I totally agree with your comment after viewing the film"Being the Change". I found that your point is accurate and sharp.
           <br><br>
The quote you have written said the film maker touches me a lot. I would love to share my point of view with you. "Wanting more has led to the climate crisis." Desire is like a blackhole in the universe, we can never see the bottom of it. People always want more and more as we gain power and wealth. Some say that desire is one important motivation that helps humans to evolve, without desire, most of the great things in this world will not be made. Desire pushes us to become better and better. It pushes us to wake up early and stay up late. Because we want our names to be typed in the Hall of Fame. But all of this comes with another side. If some have too much wealth or power, as they enjoy their fancy stuff, their heirs and other lower classes people would eat the result of the climate changes.

I found "Being the Change" to be a very interesting film in the way it incorporates spirituality, science, and activity into both relatable and effective concepts. I found it particularly inspiring how dedicated Peter was to biking to work and back everyday and made me want to reduce my own car use. I resonated with the concept of personal action transforming into collective efforts because it is something I have always believed to be true, but never felt that this class really emphasized. I always enjoy pieces that bring awareness and weight to individual actions and Peter and his family are a perfect example of realistic environmentalism. He is an average American, with a wife and two children, a car, a job, etc.. yet he manged to bring his carbon footprint down to less than 1/10th of the national average, bikes to work, uses recycled vegetable oil to run his car, and became less wasteful and more food conscious. These are things that almost everyone can implement to a certain to degree. I, personally, feel much more inclined to take larger actions toward reducing my carbon footprint and know in the future that my family will be an environmentally conscious one.

I also found this film moving in that Peter does what he can as a middle class American to do his part in lessening his carbon footprint. I feel as if living in IV, it is definitely easier to make the changes necessary to create less damage on the environment being that we have all the resources we really need in the half a square mile of area that we live on: we can bike everywhere, buy foods from the co-op here, purchase less things as we live in homes with 5+ people which we all share things, etc. It is not that hard for us to make an effort, as most of us don't really need that much anyway. We have our beds, the clothes that we own, we can make conscious food choices from either the dining halls or the restaurants/grocery stores around us, and we spend most of our time on campus or working anyway, it would be almost an effort to create more waste. With this being said though, this is not possible for everyone, as I have seen many comments on here talking about how it would be hard for their parents or family members to be able to bike to and from work if they have to haul things places to remain employed such as construction workers or cleaners etc. That is why it is important that we who can make those individual choices do, because this world is extremely imbalanced, some people's situations make it hard to be environmentally friendly, and that is understandable. Until these gaps close, and things become more accessible to everyone, those who can do their part should. I know I will.

Just like you, I also love how this documentary is able to emphasize on how personal action can possibly spark and inspire collective change. Peter’s great dedication to controlling his carbon footprint by using bikes, recycling things, and saving food truly moved me. It makes me feel guilty in the sense that I couldn’t keep up with my actions, partly because I don’t have such sheer dedication, and also because that I am always a bit suspicious that if no one is out there to join the cause, then a single personal action wouldn’t be much helpful, or at least wouldn’t get us to where we want to be. However, this documentary, as well as your comment, makes me feel that there are hopes to spark everyone to join the cause. As an ordinary person, there are definitely small things and changes that we are able to implement to a certain degree, most importantly, by keeping them up and never giving up holding on to those small things. The positive influences are always spread when some people are willing to constantly devote their efforts to impacting the people around them. After watching this documentary, I believe this is where my values lie and this is what I should go out and do.

I also agree that the film was very moving and it inspires others to follow his example. Peter like Liani mentions is an average American who was willing to change his life for the benefit of the planet and his family. It was amazing to see that Americans are beginning to wake up to the issue and take action. I know that political activism is more impactful than personal change but it is still a good step. Reducing our own carbon footprint is something we all must seek out and take action for the better. His drive to bike to work is very motivating because it shows that anyone can find a better and more sustainable substitute. If enough people can reduce their carbon footprint others will follow and maybe create a new trend that will be beneficial for the planet. It will create a ripple with mass movement behind it which will force and push our governments to take action. The change starts with our own lives and how we live it, we need to choose a life that is more sustainable and better for everyone. I think that the film highlights this theme of individual change well as it follows Peter's journey of finding a more sustainable life for him and his family.

At the beginning of “Being the Change”, I felt like things were progressing quite slowly. Interestingly, the entire film is just under an hour, as well. Since I already knew a lot of the information (at this point in my life), it was a little boring. But starting in the middle things started to get juicy. I thought the use of waste vegetable oil as fuel for his car was pretty cool. I plan to look into it--extra detail on this would be great! I found that there is apparently a TEDxTallk of Rob Greenfield talking about the food waste fiasco. I am excited to watch it. For anyone else interested, it is called “How To End The Food Waste Fiasco | Rob Greenfield | TEDxTeen”. Lastly, the concept of humanure was not new, but it definitely interests me. I am not sure how I would be able to apply it in my life right now, but I am excited to learn about it and see what I can make of it! Overall, I felt very uplifted and inspired by this film. I will share it with friends and family for sure!

I agree with you that things really started to pick up for me in the middle of the film. I've heard briefly about the use of vegetable oil as car fuel, but I've never really seen it in action before. That was super interesting for me to see. Thank you for providing a TEDxTalk that talks about this food waste issue - I'm definitely going to check it out. It's great to see more resources on these issues and possible solutions being shared through this forum because raised awareness and exposure is really what we need right now. There are so many dimensions to this larger issue of climate change, and that means there are also many ways to start combating them on an individual level. I think it is important to stress to people today that there are a variety of ways they can start to reduce their carbon footprint, so that people can feel freedom in choosing which ones they want to begin implementing in their lives. As Ken has talked about it in this week's video series, it's important that people don't feel forced to change because when people feel as though they are being forced to do something there is often a lot of resistance. By revealing to people through films like these which talk about different methods of sustainable living, we can help give people more freedom in choosing how they are going to start fighting this issue personally. For example, like you said, I don't know if I'm at a point in my life right now where I can start to fully adopt humanure, but something like a compost bin is something I plan on starting. I think it's about showing people that they have so many options that really can help..

Being the Change was a very interesting film to watch that shows the audience directly the variety of ways Peter’s family used in order to decrease the carbon emissions of the household. For example, the family decided to drive an old, vegetable oil driven car, ride bikes and get food from local or dumpster dives. Although those methods are often mentioned and discussed when people think of ways to reduce carbon emissions for themselves, it is very hard to really live in these lifestyles and persist in the changes in daily life. Because by reducing carbon emissions, people have to give up many benefits which are brought by modern technologies and live in a more inconvenient life. It makes people feel real about the changes that the family is making and reflect on their own lives. The film encourages more people to participate and really make a change in the environmental issues that we are facing right now. Maybe it is too hard for everyone to do exactly what Peter’s family is doing, but everyone has the ability to make some small changes in order to make a huge impact as the whole population, such as driving less car and riding more bikes. People need to take the environmental problems seriously and really take actions to make some differences.

"Being the Change" made the change seem simple and not too difficult. It called itself "a new kind of climate documentary" and I really believe that. The whole video was extremely down to Earth and personable. It was easy to see that Peter and his family made the changes necessary to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining a seemingly normal and happy lifestyle. Peter's dedication to being the change was inspiring. He converted his car into one that runs on vegetable oil and was so giddy about it. He was excited about it and it brought him true happiness. Not only is he ecstatic about the reduced emissions it brought, but it brought that childish joy when he was flipping the switches to make it run on vegetable oil. It was cool how he was so bothered by the climate crisis and instead of sitting in a unconscious robotic state, just going through the motions, he did something. 
<br><br>
Something that was a bit concerning for me was that even with his action, Peter was releasing 2 metric tons per year, the same amount that everyone is supposed to get below according to the Paris Agreement. It's great that he cut so much of his emissions but realistically, it's hard to see everyone switching to this in a short amount of time. Even the guy from la Casa de Paz said that he's just trying to get one person, one house, one block at a time to switch some parts of their life. Despite my slightly pessimistic view on everyone reducing their emissions as drastically as Peter did, it was inspiring to hear them talk about the issue with such excitement and optimism.

I agree with what you said about how the film made change seem so simple. The whole film to me was really eye opening because Peter made it seem so easy as to how each household had the ability to make change that would impact our environment greatly in a positive way. Like you, I found it really inspiring to see him do some of the things that were presented in the film. He made us see something that most of us thought was impossible. He truly is the epitome of the saying, “Be the change you want to see.” It was so cute and wholesome to see how he was able to convert his diesel-running car into one that runs on veggie oil waster. Making use of something that was basically waste into something that is purposeful really made me feel more hopeful about the change we can bring about if we became more mindful about how some of our actions can greatly impact the environment. 

<br><br>

I can relate to your concern regarding cutting down CO2 emissions to meet the Paris agreement. It is hard to imagine people changing their lifestyles in such a short amount of time because although, for me personally, living in a college community is so much more different than living back at home, where everything is less accessible. Society today is also so much more different than it was a decade ago. However, what gives me hope is knowing that our generation is so much more aware and are willing to educate ourselves on this topic because we are seeing the effects of what happens when policy makers ignore environmental concerns.

<br><hr>
Every change requires a unique process. After watching the film “Being the Change,” I admire the actions Peter and his family had made. Although it might be unnecessary, Peter and his wife tried their best and decided to experience the new life just to reduce carbon footprints they brought. In addition, the fact that they replace gas with vegetable oil makes me think about them as using smart and efficient methods to save our planet. I agree with the last paragraph of your comment, in which you talked about the small possibility for every individual to change their behaviors and cut such a large amount of carbon footprint. However, I still believe in the fact that if one person starts to make changes, then more and more people will be willing to do so. Therefore, I feel optimistic.

The documentary Being The Change incorporates creative ways in which Peter and his family have sought to reduce their carbon emissions to that of 1/10 of the average American. Although Peter incorporated a human manure composting system in his backyard and used vegetable oil waste for his car’s fuel, I found it particularly interesting how his lifestyle change was spurred by a spiritual awakening and meditation practices. The bliss he found through undergoing a natural and simplistic life, free from attachments heavily aligns with a lot of Buddhist ideology. Therefore, I am led to believe that some religions or one’s spiritual outlook can play a great role in how he or she values their relationship to nature. The more one feels connected to the Earth, the more likely they will care for it. For this reason, religion is an avenue that should be considered as potentially powerful for some individuals to combat climate change in everyday life. Maybe if religious institutions or their leaders take it upon themselves to incorporate discourse about human’s connection to the planet into their teachings, perhaps their follower may feel more inclined to take care of it as they view its importance to be on an existential level.

I agree with your argument that Peter experienced a spiritual awakening in perceiving the lifestyle he used to live that motivated him to take action against the climate crisis by devoting a new chapter of his life to environmental activism. I furthermore agree with your message that religion has played a role in his activist movement. He has essentially filtered all chaos from the world and solely focused on those things that truly matter such as reuniting with nature and contributing back to the natural cycle of life.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your view that religion can have an impact on people's mindset on the climate crisis. I am currently taking a religious studies course, and I've noticed that many religions condemn world desire and greed, such as Buddhism and Christianity. In both Buddhist and Ancient Greek culture (Orphics), if one was too greedy or bound by worldly desires such as money or material objects, they were barred from the higher plane of existence in the afterlife, or liberation. Although Orphic thought is ancient, there are still many who practice Buddhism, and those who are truly devoted to the religion have a carbon footprint that is a fraction of the average american. While they may consume less, we are not happier, or more content with life than them. I'm not advocating for a shift to Buddhism, but I believe that we can learn a thing or too from their lifestyle based on mindfulness and self-awareness. 
<br><br>
Another thing we can learn from was Peter from this week's film. His dedication to a lifestyle that emits 1/10 of the average american is noteworthy, because it shows us that anyone can do the same, or at least take steps in the same direction. While it might be hard to completely dedicate one's life to a greener environment, cutting down to 8/10 or 9/10 of the average american is doable and realistic. While it may not be enough, it is a step in the right direction, which is better than nothing. 
<br><br>
Finally I think your point about religious leaders is very interesting. There are many climate change deniers who won't listen to science or researches, but there's a chance that they might listen to their church leaders. If more religious figures preach environmental activism not just as a way to better the planet, but also oneself, I believe that a huge shift will take place in the way many see the climate crisis.


<br><hr>
I agree with how you said that people should be more self aware and I like how you tied it in with Peter’s car that runs on waste vegetable oil. In the documentary, “Become the Change,” Peter was so self aware of his carbon emissions that he was able to measure them. He also talks about how we can personally decide to stop eating meat, but what’s bad is if we take it one step further to say that our personal choices won't make a difference because you are just one person out of all of the other people on the planet. It’s true, but that mindset is why we’re having this problem with trying to solve climate change. If people are more self aware, then it will make it easier to find power in their personal actions to reduce carbon emissions.

I was frankly pretty unimpressed with Being The Change.  Not in terms of what they were actually doing to live entirely sustainable lives mind you, I recognize that it is quite a difficult accomplishment in many ways for them to do so, rather I was unimpressed with any attempt it had to alter how I view or live my life.  I respect the message they are trying to send out, that for us to live sustainably in the future we will need to collectively make many of the changes they did, but on an individual scale it was entirely uninspiring.  From this course I have come more and more around to the notion that I should not base my happiness on material things, and try to find enjoyment in my life from sustainable activities and lifestyles.  But frankly I believe that recycling my own excrement, dumpster diving, and many of the other things they showed here would not make me any happier.  They would likely make me unhappy actually, upon watching it I couldn't help be a little repulsed by what they were doing, even though mentally I recognize that it is all for a good purpose and more natural than any of our modern lifestyles.  I think that many people would agree with me that although yes I feel an urge or obligation to live as sustainably as possible right now, going to some of the lengths they do in the movie is out of the realm of something I would be individually willing to endure just to support the cause.  There was one scene where Peter Kalmus was talking with some other climate scientists in an interview and he stated that "I am a normal person" and the interviewer responded with "well I don't know about that".  Besides quoting this interaction because I found it kind of amusing, I wanted to point out that compared to most people Peter really is not normal.  Most people wouldn't be willing to go to half of the lengths he has gone to mitigate the climate crisis, even though they may consider it a very pressing issue.  People are simply too concerned with their already complicated lives to make drastic and sometimes very difficult changes to reduce their carbon footprint, something that individually will still have little impact on our planet.  This is again why it is all the more important for this problem to be tackled on a political and societal scale.  We cannot expect technology to solve every aspect of the climate crisis, sucking co2 out of the air or developing synthesized meats that require less land.  But what is reasonable to expect from evolving technology is to make some of the changes Peter did, without the undesirable personal element of it.  Should we as a society be recycling wasted food or making manure out of human feces?  Definitely, if it will help our planet.  Are the majority of people going to do it if it isn't implemented into our existing infrastructure to make it much easier? I do not believe so.

Tomorrow: Humans today are afraid of their own extinction. We as a whole have caused plants and animals to go extinct at rapid rates and can now feel our own end. People cannot adapt to the changes currently taking place because it is all too sudden, we let things get too out of hand. The increase in billions in our population has caused us to exploit our planet for resources. The film, “Tomorrow” takes all negative aspects of society and offers alternative lifestyles in hopes that we listen, take charge, and turn our downhill situation upside-down. 
<br><br>
The narrators in the documentary travel around the world visiting people who have made a change in their community; people take charge in hopes of creating a better, more sustainable, life for themselves and the environment. An example of human efforts taking place is the agricultural change in Detroit, Michigan. People are growing their own food and creating an urban agricultural life. I learned that small scale farmers produce most of the food we eat in comparison to large scale farms who are only concerned about feeding livestock and meeting biofuel demands. 
<br><br>
From this film, I have comprehended the importance of locally owned businesses from looking at the negatives in large corporations. In large corporations, wealth accumulated does not go into public pockets. Money from large corporations goes to lawmakers and officials who institute our policies. In conclusion, we need to use our people’s power to obtain the democracy we need and want in order to change our laws today. 
<br><br>
The overall message I grasped from “Tomorrow” is that we the people can work together in hopes of creating a better tomorrow. There will never be a perfect school but Finland is trying. There will never be a perfect democracy but Iceland is trying. So to say, nothing will ever be perfect but the vision is that power and authority can be in public hands and not just in the hands of the privileged few. We can obtain our strength from each other before it is too late. The documentary tries to make us understand that we can make tomorrow a better day than today.

Every time I watch a documentary like this, I feel so motivated to make a difference after. I want to make a change, and I start thinking of all of the ways I can do that. But after about a day or so I go back to my regular life and my daily routine. I get so caught up with everything in my life that I seem to forget there is a world outside of my own. I know this is incredibly selfish, but it seems like it the only way I can survive and keep up with everything in my life. This has gotten even worse since I got to college as I am constantly busy and stressed, just like every other college kid on the planet. This makes me wonder, who is going to make the change is we are all too busy with our own little worlds to care about the one that we all share. This documentary is incredibly interesting as it shows how one person can make a difference for the climate, and not in difficult ways. If documentaries like this are able to make me feel motivated to make a change, isn’t there something that could make us feel that motivated all of the time? Something that stood out to me about ‘Be the Change” was how it showed that the changes the narrator made in his life that helped the Earth also helped him. He seemed happier after he made the changes, which is incredibly motivating for the audience because it gives another reason to help the Earth. It also showed how one can be reliant on things other than material goods for happiness. Relating back to the “Minimalist” documentary that we watched earlier in the quarter, it really isn’t necessary to consume as many goods as we do, as it's not making us happier and can actually make us more stressed out. We just need to keep showing people that the option of being kinder to the Earth is the best option as it can still allow us to maintain our current lifestyles, just without hurting others and our planet in the process.

I couldn't help but relate to the beginning parts of your comment as I also find myself very motivated to create change after doing the assignments for this class but don't have the time or money to make a huge change. This film made me realize that there's a lot of things we can be doing differently. Although not all of us are going to be driving a vegetable oil ran car we can start by growing our own food and riding out bikes everywhere. If one of us makes a change it will still mean something but not as much as if 100 people made just one change. Now with that being said imagine those same 100 people making 3 changes, that would make significant changes in comparison to just giving up/changing one part of our lives. Peter made a similar connection in regards to flying and I couldn't agree more; " If 300 people decide not to fly, then they fly one less plane, and there's less emissions. If 3,000 people decide not to fly, then they fly 10 fewer planes and there's much less emissions."


<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment as I am guilty of the same thing. Watching a documentary and feeling inspired but then going back to the same habits in my lifestyle. I try to make little changes when I see fit and and be conscious and aware of the decisions I make but sometimes I do choose convenience over the environment. I'll take an Uber home instead of the bus or bike because I'm lazy or in a rush and I blame it on the structure of the system we live in, that its not easy to be green all the time. We are all guilty of that but this movie was interesting in that it showed a sustainable lifestyle can be achieved even under the circumstances we're in where the world is not developed for or promoting sustainable lifestyles. What also struck me about this movie was the parallels like you mentioned, to the "Minimalist" documentary where the lifestyle choices were not only better for the environment but also better for personal happiness. Their discussion of meditation actually interested me as I have found myself, not meditating but just sitting outside enjoying nature. I have made it a point this year to be outside more and enjoy nature. It truly has made me happier and more grateful for life and the nature that we do have, and it motivates me more to save it. Doing homework outside or just lying in the grass or beach is relaxing and helps me get out of the bubble of our lives and as the lady in the movie said, forget about the culture that tells us all the things we need or should have. It is humbling just to be outside and reflect on everything as it does make me want less and recognize how trivial some issues are and unnecessary some commodities are. I try to remind myself of that whenever I make  a shallow purchase or watching what I eat. Change does start from us and I think being conscious of our decisions can allow us to change our lifestyles. The lifestyle they live is better for the environment and seems so much more appealing mentally than being cooped up in a house full of things I don't need. Building connections with people through sustainable food and activity seems to be the goal that we should all be striving to. Our consumerists culture has also made us feel more alone as we replace people with stuff. Enjoying life doesn't have to be expensive as a good day can be filled with good people outside sharing a home cooked meal. This movie definitely provided a glimpse into a rewarding lifestyle that doesn't have to revolve around stuff that is both sustainable and happier.

I hadn’t watched this film before but after finishing it, I agree that it brought me lots of hope. I think in relation to climate denial-ists it serves as a valuable lesson on how a sustainable life can actually be lived and happily achieved. This feels like one of more common arguments I hear against climate change: that we simply do not have the economic resources to live the life that the Green New Deal or other climate initiatives require. I think that the people who made this film though do a really good showing that in small, self-focused actions, an eco-friendly lifestyle can be achieved. And can be done so without breaking the bank. Like you said though, it is really hard to implement changes in the long term. It’s hard not to slip back to our old ways of life and the ease that it entices. I think that the motto “be the change” though is an inspiring one that it is a lesson and a reminder for those who do believe in climate change, that they are the ones who can make a difference. I take inspiration from it myself as well. It’s very hard to imagine a completely sustainable way of life, or one that is at least conscious of sustainability in all aspects, but this film shows that it’s not impossible, and it can actually be quite rewarding.

Being the Change:<br><br>

One thing that impacted me was Peter’s motto of the head, hands, and heart in climate activism. You must first start with logic to understand the impacts (the head), then you can begin making changes to be more environmentally friendly (the hands), then those changes give you meaning and motivate you to continue making more changes (the heart). This relates to a focus of this film that environmentally friendly actions make people happier and live more meaningful lives. For example, the Tinker Repair program  not only makes the people getting free repairs happier, but also makes the volunteers happier and gives them a sense of accomplishment.
<br><br>

I found the part about meditation particularly interesting. The fact that people like Peter and Pancho Ramos-Stierle, who have scientific backgrounds, preach the benefits of meditation inspires me to incorporate it into my own life. They convey that meditation has real benefits for mental and physical well being. One thing that I found very surprising was that 40 percent of food in the US is being wasted, despite the fact that there are still millions of people who do not have enough food. This is very disturbing and also inspires me to be less wasteful with food.
<br><br>

An important message of this film is that while you may have to make sacrifices in order to live more sustainably, the sacrifices are manageable and you can choose what works best for your lifestyle. Peter mentions that he knows people who do not own cars at all to cut their carbon emissions, but that none of them have young children. For his life, he needs a car and all he can do is make the car as sustainable as possible. He also says that some people choose to not have kids because of overpopulation’s effect on the environment, but he wanted three kids and only had two, rather than having none at all. On another note, images of his children playing in the ocean and other forms of nature are prevalent throughout the film and can lead the audience to consider the effects of global warming on future generations.

The head, hands, and heart analogy in Being the Change was also the part that stood out to me the most in this film because I think it could really help people follow this path to sustainability and also happiness. When one’s heart becomes fully invested in mitigating the climate crisis, they find joy in the changes they are making instead of feeling obligated to. I also found the meditation impact interesting because I think it also connects to the head, hands, and heart. In meditation people must have an intellectual understanding to receive insight on themselves. They also must be able to physically practice the art of meditation. And lastly, they have to be passionate and intrinsically motivated to want to better themselves. I think there is a strong connection between meditation and environmentalism, because I know of a lot of people who have connected their love for meditation to their love for the Earth. 

The part of the film where Peter said he and his wife sacrificed having more children because they wanted to be more sustainable really got to me. Sometimes I find it difficult to make the sacrifice of not eating certain foods, or biking instead of driving, but Peter is making one of the biggest sacrifices in his lifes to commit himself to his path of sustainability. I truly respect Peter for all the work he has done like running a grease powered car, stop flying (which reduced his carbon footprint by a factor of 10), and using unwanted food. One other thing in the film that stood out to me was when he was talking about the predicament we currently face. In this society, we all are putting off our responsibility to this planet because we are assuming everyone else will too and therefore our actions will have little significance. Because everyone is thinking this way, little action is being done. But if everyone committed themselves to an individual life of sustainability then we would see a significant impact on our collective carbon footprint. We all have a responsibility to take action and to encourage others to take action as well.

I agree that this film had a unique approach that was more effective than I expected it to be -- after hearing about small lifestyle changes in contrast to the huge changes occurring within our planet for a while, I have become kind of worn out on this kind of rhetoric. However, this film did a really good job of presenting a genuinely happy, healthy family that enacted all of these personal changes and was still hopeful for the future. 
<br><br>

It goes to show that these changes don't have to take away from our lives, but rather they can add to them, make them more meaningful. Gardening, composting, cooking sustainably, and biking are all positive transitions that can only help the planet, but this film also showed the numerous ways that they made this family happier. It was inspiring to me to see the way this family made it their standard to think about their lives in relation to the planet every day -- not to punish themselves, but to enrich every aspect of their life.

My favorite part was the profile on the man living in Oakland committed to living in balance with his community. So often, we think of this crisis as one person against the entire world. This man showed that it doesn't have to be that way -- at least, it can be one COMMUNITY against the world. We should be constantly focused on deepening our connection to sustainably, the earth, and especially the people that inhabit the same slice of earth that we do.

I thought “Being the Change” was a very interesting film. It is incredible to see how possible it is to live environmentally conscious, and yet it still seems so far away for the majority of people. One of the things that really stuck out to me was their vegetable oil car. I’ve known about cars that run on vegetable oil for a while. My parents told me about someone they knew back when they lived in Ocean Beach who drove a vegetable oil-powered car. My mom said they always smelled like french fries. Seeing this film made me think “why don’t we all have cars like that?” It seems like such a simple solution. I’m sure it wouldn’t be so simple if everyone on the planet was doing it, but it still must be better. 
<br><br>

The other part that struck me was the section about compost. I currently keep a small compost bin in my apartment here at school, and I do that because my parents have been teaching me to compost for as long as I can remember. When I lived in Massachusetts we had a huge compost pile in our backyard, almost identical to the one the man in the video built. Now that my parents live in Berkeley, they can’t have that. Luckily they don’t need it though because the city of Berkeley provides a compost bin the same way they provide trash or recycling. I get so frustrated composting here at school because I have to walk all my rotting food to one of the compost bins on campus. Now, I am very grateful and proud that UCSB has compost bins all around campus, but I don’t understand why every city in the world doesn’t do what Berkeley does and just provide compost just like they provide recycling. It seems simple to me, and I feel like it could make a big difference.

I agree with you, “Being the Change” was not only interesting, but it was also really informative in the ways it brought up so many different solutions to live a more environmentally-friendly lifestyle that I didn’t even know existed before. Along with these aspects, it was also inspiring it the ways the narrator, Peter Kalmus, documented his journey of transitioning his lifestyle habits in order to improve the state of the planet, and the future of the planet for the sake of his children.

Another thing about this film that made it so interesting to me was how in the beginning, Peter described the frustration he felt in regards to climate change as it was clear that no one was really doing anything about it, especially people like politicians. However, instead of just continuing to be frustrated about the situation and waiting for the rest of the world to do something, he realized he is a part of the group that isn’t doing anything about it. This was what motivated him to live a different life through the use of different eco-friendly solutions he was not using before. This part of the film is so important as it depicts what so many of us are doing right now. It’s so easy to feel unmotivated to do anything about the climate change we currently face when no one in power is forcing us to make lifestyle changes. However, us humans who make up the majority of the planet are those guilty of the current states we live in, and therefore, need to be the ones to fix it. Peter’s story is inspiring as it shows in order to make a positive change on the planet, we must first look at ourselves and our lifestyle habits and be the change we want to see.

I agree with your opinion on "Being the Change." I also thought that it was intriguing how they used vegetable oil for their car. I wanted to hear a little more about it and it's pros and cons and how it worked but I guess the film didn't emphasize on that. They just mentioned how sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Like you, I was also curious on why people didn't use this idea as an alternative.
<br><br>


I like how your parents raised you to compost since you were a child. One of the analogies I enjoyed was when they mentioned how they're like a drop of water in a bucket and you can see the ripples. While they agreed that it definitely doesn't do much if one person starts being environmentally friendly, they can influence others, which is why the video of the water droplet in the bucket stuck with me. It's like how your parents are the droplets of water in the bucket and the surrounding areas were influence by it as well as you.

I definitely resonate with your thoughts on composting. Given that humans already produce so much waste on a daily basis, it is essential for us to do anything we can to reduce that amount, and composting is a great way to do so. Being from the Bay Area, I’ve grown up accustomed to compost culture; in my hometown, every house has a green trash bin and every school has signs on the trashcans indicating which waste can go in the compost. I remember that when I was little, we even had a worm composting bin in our backyard. That being said, coming to UCSB was definitely a shock; there are no options to compost in the dorm rooms (or residence halls for that matter), as they mainly focus on separating trash from recycling. Whenever I have food waste, I feel terrible about putting it in trash, but there's nowhere else to put it. While recycling is important, proper disposal of food waste is even more so. I also agree with your thoughts on providing compost options with the same importance as recycling. It’s relatively easy, but extremely beneficial. 

<br><br>

As a whole, I thought “Being the Change” was interesting, informative, and eye-opening. Watching Peter live his life both sustainably and happily reassured me that an environmentally-friendly lifestyle would be beneficial to both oneself and the world. While it may take a long time for his lifestyle to be adopted into society, I believe that there are many small actions he highlighted throughout the film that could more easily become part of daily life. Although small changes aren’t perfect, they still lead to improvement. Once people realize that a life of sustainability doesn’t mean giving up the joys of life, the idea of an eco-friendly life becomes more attainable.

To be honest, in the documentary “Being the Change,” Pete drives his car by using vegetable oil really shocked me. I have thought of many ways to reduce the carbon footprint, such as wasting less food and using more public transportation, but I have never thought of emitting the existing CO2 (vegetable oil) into the air directly. Such a novel view surprised me, and I’m also upset that I still do not escape from the shackles of the material society, thinking that cars can only use gasoline, otherwise it will damage the cars.
<br><br>
In addition, I like the part of Peter playing guitar and singing with his wife. Two people who love each other snuggle up together and do some happy things together. They live in an ordinary way, escape from the money-oriented society, educate children, keep pets, and live by each other. It's not easy to be able to work hard and have fun in such a fast-paced society, revealing profound significance in plainness. However, what does this mean for, a single dog, me?
<br><br>
Finally, picking up food from the trash can also open my eyes. I know that people waste a lot of food every day, and I also know that cherishing food has a great positive impact on the earth. However, if I am asked to eat the food in the garbage can directly, I still can't do it. Therefore, I admire those who are willing to do it in order to protect the environment. They are really great.

I was also shocked by that, because frankly I didn't even know you could use vegetable oil for cars. However, this is very innovative and just goes to show that we can think of creative ways to be more environmentally friendly. I don't drive, but even if I did I feel like it would be so much work to use vegetable oil and probably wouldn't use it often. I also feel kind of guilty for knowing how bad carbon emissions from gasoline are but still using cars when it's convenient for me. 
<br><br>
I also loved that part because it just goes to show that it's the simple things in life and those around us who can really make us happy, not just materialistic things. I can easily get caught up in a materialistic mindset when I'm out shopping or even online shopping. Also, the food part was interesting because I don't think I could ever do that but I am trying to waste less food and eat all the food I buy. I think that serving sizes should definitely be much smaller than they are right now, because that's probably one of the main reasons so much food is wasted. 
<br><br>
Overall, I totally agree with your comment and I do believe that we can think of creative ways to be more environmentally friendly and reduce our carbon emissions little by little.

If more films were made like "Being the Change", we would definitely see more change. I think it's easier for people to be convinced when they see other human beings in action. Peter Kalmus shows how living a sustainable lifestyle is not difficult at all and his family seems to be genuinely happy. I also live in the San Gabriel Valley but I never paid much attention to how car friendly it is. Looking back on it, it seems like the every community within the San Gabriel valley is designed for cars. Another thing that both of these films had me thinking about is the amount drive-thru restaurant and coffee shops are emerging. All this is doing is encouraging people to make use of their cars and wait in them instead of using our damn legs to walk into the store. Americans are the laziest.

I totally agree with both of your points! In "Being the Change", it was amazing to see how everyone in Kalmus' family and those around them were so happy with their lifestyle. They're emitting far less and seem to be living a more happy and peaceful life. Like you said, if more people shared stories similar to this one, I see no reason why even more people wouldn't convert to this way of living. There seems to be no downside; they're happier, more in shape, they emit 1/10th of the CO2 of the average American and spend less money on a variety of things. What more could you want? They say money can't buy happiness and I think this is the perfect example of that. 
<br><br>

On the other hand, moving to California this year made me realize just how car-friendly the state is. It seems like you have to get in a car and drive on a highway to get anywhere. The bike paths are dangerous and walking anywhere takes twice as long as it should. In fact, I walked to my friend's apartment in Isla Vista last week and everyone there was surprised that I had walked "so far" - it was a fifteen minute walk. So, I think it was really cool how Kalmus and his family only have one car and that it runs, mostly, on used vegetable oil. One person can't change the infrastructure of an entire state, but there are many feasible alternatives to driving a car all the time.

In the documentary Tomorrow, the filmmakers
effectively convey the main idea of the film. The film describes “re-inventing
agriculture, energy, economy, democracy and education” in circulation. At the
beginning of the movie, it is mentioned that if people do not change their
current lifestyles, humans are likely to become extinct before 2100. As a
result, a small group of like-minded people is looking for a new type of cycle
around the world, including the United States, Britain, and Denmark. In terms
of agriculture, experts firmly believe that micro-artisan agriculture is the
best way to solve future human food, not a large-scale mechanized farm. Micro
artificial farms have the benefits of high efficiency and yield and are
sufficient to feed the world's population. In terms of energy, the company is
shifting from using fossil fuels to using zero-cost solar and wind energy. At
the economic level, a single currency is gradually being replaced by a
diversified currency to re-stimulate a small local economy. Democracy is
equally important in this cycle. When government policies cause dissatisfaction
among the general public, they will march and speak out. In India, some
villages tried to break the caste system and got good results. And education is
the root of everything. In Finland, teachers adopt new teaching methods. The
classroom atmosphere is relaxed and diverse, making students more willing to
learn. This new cycle is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems.
<br><br>

Among them, the city that impressed me most was the urban
farm. A man who is farming tells us that people will think that peasant status
should not appear in cities, and peasants have a low social status. However,
these urban farmers use their results and yields to tell everyone that this
method is feasible and there is no difference between such people and others.
<br><br>

If I rate the film, I will score 9 out of 10. This is a
good movie that tells us how to solve the problem of climate change. However,
it still needs time to test whether this film is too utopian.



</p><hr>

<p>

The film generally emphasizes that it is important to be sustainable. What it actually mean is that we have the ability to take care of ourselves, like planting food for us to eat. This part truly inspires us to be a climatarian, to act an activist to protect the Earth. Also, when considering which jobs to take in future, we also need to consider about whether it is harmful to Earth. For example, In San Francisco, they have trash cans for plants that they give to farms as compost. The film mentions that compost can save 3/4ths of carbon emissions in California because the plants are going back into the earth, where they should be.

I liked this week's film, "Being the Change" because it showed the family comfortably living a simplistic, minimalist lifestyle. When he said that his CO2 emissions are 1/10th of what an average American's is I was left completely shocked. A huge part of our lifestyles contribute in one way or another to the climate crisis so it seems to me like such a huge accomplishment that Peter was able to reduce his carbon emissions to two tons. It seemed like he put in a lot of effort to be more minimalist and less harmful to the environment, but he proved it is possible and attainable! In lectures Ken given us multiple means that we as individuals can take action and help reduce our carbon footprint, but most of the time I was left completely overwhelmed by the whole topic. 
<br><br>
However knowing that an entire family has already done this gives me the motivation to actually choose to implement these changes now that I think it might not be as difficult as I thought it would be. Although in the beginning made me think I would not relate well with the movie, it was a great choice to show our class as it allows us to see a real life example of the things we're discussing in lecture. In addition it brought a different aspect into light; it illustrates how our families and life at home will be affected to our response to the climate change.

Seeing a family live this type of lifestyle is great. It does bolster my argument I made on other videos. My argument was that sometimes you need to actually show people to prove that it works. Statistics and academic papers can only do so much. Me personally, I can look at the statistics and proceed based on those numbers. For some people, you are going to need something visual. Once someone sees that it can work, it can persuade people to change their routine.

Unlike many people, who dreams of living in big cities, living in a house in a countryside with loved ones and looking at the sky full of skies every night has been my goal for life because I think living a life like this could really provide me with pure happiness rather than materialistic happiness that I can acquire from consuming. I really love the way Peter Kalmus lives his life and I’m happy to see that his action helps him reduce his carbon footprint to almost 1/10 of the average American. It’s also interesting to see how Peter changed his attitude towards the climate issue after having his own kids, and I think it’s very true that we need to seriously think about the future of our subsequent generation when we do things.

The documentary "Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution" is about a man named Peter Kalmus who reduced his emissions to 1/10th of the average American. Unlike the other films, he showed us solutions of what we can do in our daily lives to reduce emissions. One of the ways that he reduced his emissions was through driving a car that runs on vegetable oil that he gets from local restaurants. I have never heard of using vegetable oil as an alternative to gasoline so it definitely surprised me that it was even possible. I loved when he said that his car is putting CO2 into the air that came out of the air instead of CO2 that came from underground (like gasoline). 
<br><br>

Furthermore, I liked how the film mentioned how people feel that if they switch to biking or if they fly less, they won’t feel like they are making a difference in mitigating global warming. Considering the fact that there are more than 7 billion people on this planet, I have to say, I have felt the same way.  But his explanation of the plane scenario really showed me why it’s important that I fly less. Kalmus said that if one person decides they aren't going to fly, then the plane will still fly. But if 300 people decide not to fly then one less plane is going to fly. And if 3000 people decide not to fly, 10 less planes will fly. At the end of the day, it is what we do as a collective that will make a difference. However, it starts with the individual. Finally, I loved how we got to hear from Peter’s friend who made the “Casa de paz” and to hear about the “Repair Cafe.” It was so beautiful to see how selfless people are and how they are willing to help people and make them feel good. The “Repair Cafe” would not only make the person who got the repair feel happy but also made the technician happy. Moreover, people were able to keep using their technology instead of throwing it away and buying a new one, which contributes to waste. Both the “Repair Cafe” and the “Casa de paz” helped bring the community together and I thought it was so beautiful to see this positive change.

I also liked the way Peter explained the impact of small scale change through the example of airplanes. In terms of the magnitude of people now aware of the pressing danger of climate change, 300 people choosing not to fly per day, or even 3000 is completely reasonable. Similar to you, I was truly astounded at how selfless some people are. Such as Peter’s friend (owner of Casa de paz) said that serving others was the true path to happiness. It was incredible how such talented and successful people were so willing to turn their lives around for a good cause. I also like how Peter’s friend called this the “Great turning” and the way he described it was incredibly optimistic. In terms of the repair cafe, I also thought this was a really cool idea. Although I personally cannot imagine having fun repairing technology, it's really cool that there are people out there who genuinely enjoy it. Personal changes aside, I fully endorse the Carbon fee and dividend mentioned by that climate scientist. If people won’t make changes themselves, the government can at least take action to limit the destructive capability of fossil fuel companies. I also liked how concisely he explained what “revenue neutral means”, as he put it we would be taking the money from the fossil fuel companies and returning  it directly to US households. This way, we are not only disincentivizing more coal extraction, but compensating for some of the negative consequences caused by the tax. I  was also surprised when the person at the Citizens Climate Lobby put the “Co2 stays in the atmosphere up to 500 years” statistic into perspective by mentioning what was happening back in 1414.


<br><hr>

I agree with all of your opinions. As a climate scientist working at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, Peter Kalmus presents me how he lives a simple, low-carbon, and happy life, reducing his carbon footprint from 20 tons to 2 tons of CO2 per year. Together with his wife and his children, Brad and Zane, Kalmus often eats in the yard under a beautiful avocado tree, enjoying the peace and family’s company. His tattoo means “correct awareness” and “equanimity”, which corresponds his lifestyle that relates better with the people in his life. Same as you, it’s my first time hearing about using waste vegetable oil to drive the car and it definitely surprises me. In this way, Kalmus truly contributes to mitigating climate crisis in his daily commute. He collected wasted vegetable oil from the local restaurant and releases CO2 into the air that came out of the air, which is really creative. 
<br><br>

    As Peter said, everything he does is like a tiny drop and he wants to influence the community and people around him. If people around the world do the same thing, the issue could change. Therefore the Individual action is at least as important as collective action. Besides Peter’s own life, the film also shows many of his friends’ sustainable lifestyles. One of his friends often searches the dumpster for wasted food that is still good and delicious, which is his individual action. He then tried to make other people rethink about their waste habit by presenting all good foods that he found in the dumpster, wearing plastics , and interviewing people about their reflections of waste. Like Peter, this is an example that one persists in his personal action while continues trying to evoke collective action. I also found that the core message of “Being the Change” is deeply optimistic: it demonstrates that living without fossil fuels is not only possible, but it can also be better, and achieving this goal requires each of us to act.



<br><hr>
I too was pleasantly surprised by Kalamus’s use of vegetable oil to power his car Maybe. This wasn't the only thing Kalamus was able to do though that astonished me. Like you mentioned, he also lowered his CO2 output from 20 to 2 tons of CO2 a year. To do this, he made many changes in his lifestyle and took steps to get to where he is now. I definitely respect this about Kalamus and he inspires me to make better environmental choices myself. I thought his idea about people flying was very interesting as you mentioned. If 300 people decide not to fly, then it takes one less plane out of the sky, and decreases CO2 emissions. This is the kind of thinking that needs to be taking place on a daily basis, not just in terms of flight. People need to start asking themselves these types of questions. It is a revolution in the mindset of others that leads to change. If people have the mindset that they’re only one person and what they do couldn't possibly have an effect on the planet, then they are already defeated. However, if people have the opposite mindset and tell themselves that what they do makes a difference, a large difference, then the numbers will start to show for it. I think that as great of a thing it is that Kalamus takes all of these different approaches to living his life in an environmentally friendly way, it is most important that he changes the way people approach the problem, and it starts with their mindset. 
 <br><br>
Another idea that Ken touched on in his video was that living a life with reduced CO2 emissions is an awful way to live, when in fact it can be the opposite. People nowadays have become caught up in the epidemic of social media influencers that they are convinced that the only way to live a successful life is if you can afford the most expensive and luxurious items that are not only wasteful but unnecessary completely. In fact, the best lived lives are ones based on relationships and experiences, not material items that bring only momentary amounts of happiness.

This documentary shocked me the most out of all the films we have delved into thus far. Peter Kalmus broadened my imagination of ways to cut back on my own CO2 emissions. Personally, I tried to incorporate the things we have discussed such as flying less, biking more, consuming less, and buying less. After watching this, I realized there are people out there like Peter who are truly so devoted to replenishing our Earth. He is a model of how everyone should aim to live. Peter embodies minimizing food waste, replenishing our soils, minimizing harmful  transportation, and overall minimal consumption. He sacrifices so many of the technological conveniences of life in order to help fix our planet. I am guilty of ubering to the nearest store because I am too lazy to bike a mile. Peter made me realize that little things like biking to the store really do add up. I used to think that my actions won't help, I am just one person. But, Peter made me realize that if one person starts a movement towards better living, others will soon follow. It is imperative, however, that people try to make changes soon, that is something Peter Kalmus does not emphasize. It is great that with this film they are encouraging the ones who view it to take action, however most likely people that do choose to watch this film are already climate activists. A film like this needs to be released more towards people who do not believe or believe and do not want to make changes. There are ways to fix this issue, starting with the way we live life on a daily basis. I might as well do my part because I know I do not want my kids to have to be stuck with the burden of cleaning up our mess. I do not know if I can dive into dumpsters quite yet, but I will start by eating a plant based diet.

Being the Change:
 <br><br>
I agree with you whole-heartedly. Watching this film truly inspired me. Throughout this class, we have always talked about changing certain things in our life whether it's politically, culturally, mentally or physically. This film showcased a real-life family actually carrying out these changes. If I am being honest, I did not think that implementing those changes we've talked about would be effective and realistic because of the society we live in today. So, it was really interesting to see a family adopt those changes and consistently stick through it. I was really impressed by how Peter thought to use reusable vegetable oil to power his car with no CO2 emissions. Sure, he was to make quite a trip to obtain the oil but it seems that it was worth it. I was also happy to see that his wife and kids walk/bike to school every day. I feel that some parents would not adopt that change because perhaps they may be in a rush to work and therefore use their car to take their kids to school. I additionally wanted to point out how their family had an outdoor shower and toilet.

The film "Being the Change" was a very interesting insight into the lives of people who are living more sustainably, and surprisingly, it looked like a very manageable and fun life to live. We usually have these misconceived notions that to cut down on carbon emissions and other things that are harmful to the environment would lead to a miserable or unfulfilling life, yet the family in the film was living a sustainable lifestyle while also cutting down on their emissions. The little shifts in their lifestyle such as biking, having a compost bin, eating healthier and locally, are all possible for us to do. As said in the film, having more is not always better, and living more simplistically does not mean that your life will be boring. The fact that the large amounts of foods are wasted in this world and yet people are still starving is extremely disheartening, and if we are all more aware of this we can make changes in our lives and change the culture around wasting food.

The American culture has drilled us to think that in order to be content and live a fulfilling life, we need to constantly have more and more. It's a horrible way of life especially since it programs us to feel bad about ourselves if we don't have the best of the best of anything. What's the whole big deal about having the newest Mercedes or BMW? Years from now, our friends won't remember what car we drove back in high school. So why not ride a bike or take the bus? That alternative can save a massive amount of money in the long run plus it is so much better for our environment. Essentially, a lifestyle that promotes eco-friendly habits, is healthier for ourselves more than we can imagine. The food, the exercise, everything! We just need to stop being so consumed by what we think we need and replace it with what our planet needs. Or what our future generations need. There are so many families like the one in "Being the Change" and we must learn from them. Their life is amazing in all aspects and there's a lot we can learn from that.

I found the documentary, "Being the Change", to be very intriguing and different from typical environmental documentaries. I was very surprised as to how many changes that Peter had made in order to reduce his carbon footprint and emissions through daily activities, such as fixing a car to run on waste vegetable oil and going grocery shopping with foods that are rendered "unsellable" in stores. I was very moved by his intrinsic motivation to lead a more sustainable lifestyle. I felt that the film deeply demonstrated the great change every individual can create by starting with themselves and creating greater positivity in the community and world. The argument that if only one person chooses to be more environmentally sustainable, it would have little to no effect if the rest of the population continues to live in excess and technological dependent. seems to lack substance. However, after viewing this film, I felt that if even a small number of people decide to change one thing and slowly add new changes to their lives, there will be momentous change. It is inspiring to not only themselves to do even more and better, but also to those close around them, and so forth. Change begins in small numbers and its growth will create the change needed in order to save the planet.

I also found the documentary "Being the Change" to be interesting and original. Before I began watching, I did not expect the film to be about one family's life and how they changed their everyday habits in order to benefit the planet. I enjoyed their story because it proved to me that individual action can go a long way when it comes to the environment. His and his family's actions are extremely inspiring, and they are a great way to get others to take action as well. 
 <br><br>
It was extremely impressive to me that he was able to run his car on vegetable oil. He was creative and found a way to slightly reduce his carbon footprint while still being able to drive a car. A great deal of people, including myself, think it would be too difficult to completely stop using a car solely for the sake of the environment, but he is showing us the it is possible to still own a car and be environmentally friendly. This was another reason I enjoyed the film. This family was able to show everybody that it is possible to live a classic suburban lifestyle while still making choices that will help save the planet. This family was able to prove everybody wrong. 
 <br><br>
I agree with your statement that when a small amount of people decide to take action, others will follow behind. "Being the Change" is a step in the right direction because it shows people that it is possible. If people are able to watch this documentary, I believe that it can inspire them to change their daily lifestyle for the better.

I agree with you. Peter has made so many personal changes and he is always making changes and trying to motivate other peers to make a change. He proposes that head, hand, and heart. He has made all three standards. He thinks about how to make a change and how to live in nature. He uses a car with no carbon emissions. He rides a bike to work. He encourages his family to ride bikes also. He makes speeches to others. He’s done so many and looking at myself, I do fewer changes in comparison to him. For me, I'd like to walk or take buses to school. Also, I seldom buy fast fashions which is extremely bad for the environment. However, I still have not done enough.  I believe every one of us should really start to think in our head and do something by hand. It is time for our generation to make changes. Living in a micro-apartment, eat local food, take public transportation...tec All of these are plausible and effective to protect our earth from the climate crisis. If everyone contributes a little, there can be a great protection for our planet and environment. It is not easy for him to persist to make changes and because he has an intrinsic motivation as you commented, he can insist on live environmentally friendly. Just like what professor ken said, we need to change for better of ourselves, our life, species, and our future.

Being the Change was an important film because it showed that living a lifestyle that conforms to the necessary measures needed to rescue our environment. Peter was able to maintain his family's lifestyle while still managing to reduce his carbon footprint to 1/10th that of an average American. While he could not completely eliminate contributors such as his car, he was able to find a way to make it more environmentally friendly  by converting its fuel and reducing its use by relying more on biking and walking. Converting the car to run on vegetable oil works not only makes the car efficient but also addresses the issue of food waste as it repurposes what would otherwise be disposed of. These changes are not necessarily practical for everyone, more for families with the stability and comfort like Peter's to make these alterations to their lifestyles. For many, relying on biking alone would not be enough to get them to work due to a long commute or in the case of families, would not be able to meet needs such as transporting your family. However, the less significant changes can still contribute to the big picture if a larger number of people can implement them.

I agree with you and I think it is important for everyone to know that we do not need to something significants to help the climate issues. We do not need spend a lot of money, time or efforts, instead little single things will work if we can continue doing these and we have enough people doing that. It is true that a lot of things can not be stoped just like some flights you have to take or sometimes you have to drive, all these are understood-able, but we can do during the normal times are important. It is proven that we can live well even if we cut our footprint to only 1/10. I know it is hard to believe, even it is hard to imagine. But once you start it, you will reveal the truth. Just like a video talks about you can not believe how many things a college students can done without his phone in one hour. The results might sound unbelievable, but once you start to practice, you will know. It is never a bad idea for us to just try to start the new way, it does not need to be significant things. If everyone can do a little bit of small things, the number will be large if we can combined.

This film is a great example for everyone to follow. The fact that one man, Peter Kalmus, was able to reduce his carbon footprint by 90% should inspire everyone and make us realize that it is doable. From using vegetable oil as fuel to creating organizations promoting donations, everything this man did teaches us that reducing our carbon footprint is not hard at all. All the examples he shows the audience makes it very difficult to raise any excuses as to why everyone is not doing even the slightest changes to help the planet.

I found this documentary inspiring because usually we look at people making environmental changes as people who don’t care about technology and who live in the woods. It was interesting to me that the person who was followed in this movie is someone who lives in Pasadena and works at JPL. And similarly knowing that the subject followed was an employee at JPL, one might assume that technological innovations would be the environmental changes promoted. However, he takes it back to the basics and talks about how things like biking can often be one of the biggest and most important changes you can make. He said chooses to make these decisions for three reasons, "1. it's fun to live with less fossil fuels - it allows for a more personal connection to the land, 2. Moving away from fossil fuels aligns his actions with his principles, and 3. these changes of one person help shift a culture, and start the conversation,” he said he wouldn’t change a thing about it. 
 <br><br>

One thing that alarmed me was when he spoke about people paying voluntary carbon offsets. I never really understood how these programs worked, but I also never questioned it - I was happy that some people would choose to do this. And while this is certainly better than doing nothing, “the idea behind carbon offsets is to pay some company a modest sum (around $30 for a transatlantic flight) to "offset" the carbon emission of the flight by planting trees.” This was important for me to note because these offsets are marketed heavily as good options, but we should note that we still aren’t solving the larger issue.

Tomorrow is really an optimistic documentary. The filmmaker presents his thinking about the future from four aspects, including agriculture, energy, democracy, and education. By learning about stories of interviewees from different backgrounds, I have a deeper understanding of climate change. 
 <br><br>

For agriculture, one way that people tried to fight climate change is building a city garden. That part was my favorite in the film. People grew different kinds of plants nearby street or just in a given area. That made people get involved in their life both for adults and kids. In addition, for energy, the government encouraged to develop recycling. The way did not only solve the problem of dealing with waste but brought energy from waste. Also, the company can gain about twenty percent of new material from the whole waste. Maybe in the future, our life will have a close relationship with our waste. The filmmaker also gave an example of people’s life in France. Only about thirty percent of citizens drive in the city, which means the whole city’s carbon emission kept in a low situation. Furthermore, for democracy, governments’ decision was associated with many large companies. Those companies gained cheaper energy and raw material from waste, thus supporting the government to develop recycling. Even though the government bow to companies’ financial support, it was a chain reaction about fighting environment problems. Finally, for education, our future is decided by the model of education. The filmmaker described a new education model that holds Kids, form 7-15, study together. The main purpose of this was to teach students how to learn in such an environment that knowledge is available everywhere. I think the next generation will be totally different and better than us.

I watched "Being the Change." In the documentary/film, Peter said that the best ways to raise awareness is by using your voice. He advised that we do so by doing it by a medium that you are familiar with, and enjoy. As he discussed how we can each effectively communicate our awareness, I remember him saying something along the lines of, if you're a writer, write a book about it and if you're an artist, draw attention to this crisis through your artwork; this actually makes sense. When we participate in climate activism by doing something we love, it becomes so much more valuable. But not only are we doing something we love we are spreading knowledge and awareness that is critical to humanity.

I like that you mentioned “when we participate in climate activism by doing something we love, it becomes much more valuable.” I 100% agree with you. If your activism feels forced then there isn't really much meaning behind it. As Peter Kalmus mentioned in the film, there are three parts when it comes to climate activism: the head, the hand, and the heart. He mentions how the heart is what ties everything together, it is where you find meaning behind your actions. If you don't find personal value in what you're doing you won't enjoy it, you’ll get tired and bored of it, and no longer want to participate. I also agree with Kalmus that we should spread awareness through our art. I've always loved making art so I understood where he was coming from. Everything I make, whether that is stitching designs on my clothing, painting, writing, all have personal value to me. So if we are able to create awareness through our pieces, not only does it make it a lot more fun to do, but perhaps encourages others to join the movement and do the same.


<br><hr>

I 100% agree with this, for most of us it might be hard to implement a lifestyle that shortens our carbon footprint but if we have something that we enjoy that the earth can benefit from in some way just do that. For example if you have a busy life where it’s really hard for you to shorten your carbon footprint but you can advocate for it such as Leonardo DiCaprio then do that. Pay a carbon tax, raise awareness if that’s the only option you have. I think this is a really great message that everybody should implement into their lives.

The documentary Tomorrow begins with the immediate problem being addressed, that human population has tripled, and will continue to grow within the next few years. Climate change is such an issue that it makes it extremely difficult for us to adapt because of how fast change actually is. One of the first points addressed in the film is agriculture, emphasized as perhaps one of the easiest ways to reduce our carbon footprint, along with transportation. I find it so fascinating that their team was able to venture out to different places of the world, and one being Detroit, where a broader perspective of planting their own food was gradually growing in becoming normal. The people working the farms introduce to their team how they want to be able to grow their food closer to the city area, and explained to them how local food production has allowed people to live better lives. This film is able to provide beneficial solutions in the way we can make a difference in the world and introduces this concept again how much today’s conception can be avoided. I never really realized how much harm people cause to the environment, myself included, especially when it was brought up that manufacturing 1 smartphone sends 125 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. I understood that there are so many ways for us to reduce the way we consume things and change our habits that contribute to the earth’s atmosphere in such a negative way. The film presents these solutions in which we can incorporate on a day-to-day basis, and not forget that we put out more carbon into the air then we realize it, and in turn be cautious on our carbon footprint.

What really caught my attention about the documentary “Being the change”, was when peter drove a car powered by vegetable oil. At first, I was like wow can you really power a car with lipids. And I also thought well doesn’t that emit CO2 too but then he mentioned how he he was just emitting co2 that had already been in the air, that he was not adding any back. That is truly admirable. It is also fascinating to watch how peter challenges the idea of using technology to create change. He goes on to create change by a less technological way. Instead of installing solar panels, he chooses a more personal approach. A point that is also brought in the documentary is that if you perform individual action, you should let people know about it. This documentary has really changed the way I view things. I feel motivated to try something similar to what peter did and perhaps tell people about it. I would not mind riding a car powered by cooking oil. I always liked riding a car and thinking that I may no longer ride one to create change, did not convince me very much. But this film gave me hope  that I can still ride a car and not emit more co2 into the air.

I was surprised too when I saw Peter filling up his car with vegetable oil. I didn’t know this was possible. By doing this, Peter is both ditching gas and using oil produced by restaurants (that was going to be thrown away) in a reasonable way. I also loved how this film addressed the worry Peter was experiencing when he first learned about climate change because for the majority of the time I feel like him when it comes to this issue. There are times when I’m optimistic and I have hope in knowing that we are capable of fixing this issue, but at the same time there are times where I think we’ve lost time and the fact that the “president” in office doesn’t consider climate change a serious issue, gives me anxiety and anger. However, if we decide to do our part individually to reduce carbon footprint instead of waiting for others, then we should be happy knowing that we did our part to help. Furthermore, there was a part of the film where the process of human compost was explained and to be honest I think this the first thing in this class that I’m not sure how to feel about. I do believe that we should do everything within our reach to have a zero carbon emission lifestyle as close as possible, but I don’t think I ‘ll be joining this type of compost any time soon. Other than that, living a sustainable life or simply doing something small for the planet does make you happier. Peter is such a great example of this, if he can change his lifestyle to a more sustainable one even after having two kids, then we can achieve it too!


<br><Hr>
I agree with you on the part about where he powered his car on vegetable oil, it was honestly the part where the documentary became interesting to me and I started paying closer attention. His ingenuity to use such a product is the way to combat climate change and every little step along the way just gets closer and closer to a greener and cleaner future. Another thing that I really agreed with was the idea of completely giving away cars in the hope to reduce CO2 emissions.  This documentary really helped push along the idea that we can live in a world where we are not producing so much pollution and it can happen from person to person albeit it can be difficult to create a system like Peter's. Ultimately it was really encouraging to see Peter change his lifestyle for the better and I give him props for making such a change and working through it instead of around.



<br><Hr>
Yea, the vegetable oil part of this video is what caught my attention too. I never realized this was something actually feasible. It leaves me hopeful that maybe one day in the future we can transition to a method of fuel that is less harmful to the environment than the current options. I hope more innovative creations like this are invented that way people won’t have to completely change their lifestyle in order to cut back on emissions (it is hard to convince the masses to completely change their lifestyle).




<br><Hr>

I agree with your comment post. Just like you, I was also amazed by Peter's vigilance on the idea of utilizing technology to create change. Previously, I was skeptical at first on centralizing technology as a solution to the climate crisis due to the fact that resources being utilized could often contribute to CO2 emission or that funding such a project could be pricey for our society. However, that wasn't the case when Peter introduced the car that was powered by vegetable oil. As you mentioned, I too, was motivated to create or to be part of something creative that could be utilized by the public in seeking alternatives or solutions for the climate crisis. After watching the film, It definitely rekindled my hopes to rely on technology and the creativity of humanity in solving this issue.



<br><Hr>
The part of the documentary with the vegetable oil caught my attention as well. I think I remember reading or seeing something a long time ago about someone else suggesting vegetable oil be used for cars, but I forgot about it until that point in the documentary. It made me realize that maybe super advanced improvements in technology aren't the only things we need to combat climate change - we can do it in other personal methods like you said. I think there's no one strict way to limit our impact on the environment, but it's really cool to see the different approaches people can take. Peter's methods are pretty innovative and inspiring.




<br><Hr>


That part caught my attention as well. I was very pleased to hear that Peter takes less expensive actions to help the environment on his own, and shares them with us in this film. I realized that there are pretty simple actions we can all take to help lower our carbon footprints that are not too expensive. I always thought that it was difficult to actually make a big difference in one's emissions, especially in the future when I have a family of my own, but after watching how he does it, I was left feeling inspired. I love how he found his own unique way of lowering his carbon emissions from 20 tons to 2 tons! He didn't have to use expensive ways such as solar panels and even found way he could still use his car without doing immense damage to the environment. This just goes to show that we can all take different approaches in our own little ways to lower our emissions as well.

The first quote that caught my attention from Being the Change was “Throw my bottle away. Where is ‘away’? There is no ‘away’?” It really stuck with me how ridiculous and stupid it is that that phrase is so common. Throwing things away is such a common normal part of life. We throw away our trash, old food, old clothes, things that touched the floor, and the list goes on and on. We are indeed rapid consumers and as a result rapid wasters. It is truly insane and I am not sure if I am yet at the stage of humanure, but I truly believe we need to keep talking about the climate crisis and individually do what we can to make a change. “Global warming is a direct result of wanting more” is another quote that stood out to me. It truly is. We aren’t growing with the goal of being the best version of a society we can be, or healthiest, it is literally the goal of gaining more and more with less and less effort. 
 <br><br>


Companies take advantage and feed into this fear that things like makeup and new shoes and the newest whatever is necessary to be happy. I think people should really take the time to think about what is necessary and anything beyond that what is the cost of the luxury we choose to add to our lives and how far are we willing to go. Honestly how much is ‘having it all’ and why do you want it? Corporations are making bank of our consumerism so it is not up to them to initiate change, it is up to the consumers to demand it. If we start demanding environmentally friendly advances, technology and growth will meet those demands. “Be the change you want to see in the world.” Being the change is a lot of work. I think taking the mindset of just a new step each week or each month is so important and is a way to begin.

I really appreciated your comment! That first quote totally flew over my head but when you think about it, the accuracy is scary. There really is no 'throwing anything' away, and the statistic that 40 percent of the food produced isn't even consumed is ridiculous. I honestly don't know why we are here thinking that just because we put something in the trashcan it automatically leaves the earth.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with this comment, our society is brainwashed into a rapid consumer lifestyle. It may be hard to break this habit as we have been seeing ads and commercials since we were children showing that there is always something better and newer out there and not having it makes you lesser. The public truly needs to be educated about the issue before any change can occur and one quote I found useful from this documentary is "the head, the hand, and the heart." This is a great way to motivate people the change their lifestyle by first giving them the intellectual understanding, then the means to be more eco-friendly, and last and most important is to find the meaning in undergoing this lifestyle change.
 <br><br>
Another thing that stood out to me in this documentary and would certainly help with our rapid consumerism is the Repair Cafe in Pasadena that repairs anything for free. The fact that there is no cost is already a great motivator and fixing old appliances and clothes instead of throwing them out would help greatly in an individual's carbon footprint and the embedded carbon footprint that goes into building a whole new appliance. The workers are also happy with this experience which shows great positivity and hope regarding this new movement.




<br><hr>
The quote about bottles also stood out to me on this watch. This was my second time watching "Being the Change" since it was also a film assignment for Ken's class last quarter, but this second viewing allowed me to notice things that I hadn't before, like that first quote you mentioned. Consumerism has been repeatedly covered to death in this class, but for good reason. It's merely more of a testament to how ingrained consumerism is to the culture of America. I agree greatly that in order to step away from this standard of desire, every individual must evaluate whether materialism and wanting more really makes them happy. Consumers are bombarded by a mythical ideal of happiness on a day-to-day basis, whether that be through advertisements on social media, one-on-one water cooler talk, or promotions on television. Stepping away from that even just by thinking about it on a per week or per month basis can drastically change one's outlook on life. Peter Kalmus and the others shown in the film are a testament to this matter. They realized the direness of the climate crisis and rather than wallow in despair, they decided to be the change and encourage others to do so as well. I hope that this film and Tomorrow (Demain) with their models of individual change can help inspire others to do the same.

One of the main aspects of the climate crisis that is constantly talked about is not necessarily how the climate crisis happened but in what ways can we fix it now before it is too late. As I have seen in the United States and other well developed countries, people tend to want to try and fix anything and everything with new technology, but in context to the climate crisis, excess technology can only make things worse. Excess technology leads to excess waste which would not help the planet at all, even if this technology is making gentle strides towards becoming a more sustainable planet. In my own opinion, I believe our country should shift to a more conservative way of living instead of just taking on more expensive or non-environmentally friendly ways of becoming more sustainable.  Some examples of this are eating less non-sustainable meat or going vegetarian, instead of investing in solar panels. By making these simple lifestyle changes in your own life without the need of materialistic things, we could go a long way in terms of starting the process to save our planet from global warming.

<p>
I think "Being The Change" is a great documentary to make people self reflect their lifestyle choices and evaluate if their decisions are sustainable for the environment.  Watching Kalmus reduce his carbon footprint was inspiring to me and made me think about the ways I could reduce my own footprint. Kalmus made his life changes in easy ways that everyone can do, which can make the appeal greater. By reducing his footprint by 1/10th it reallys shows how much we do things that do not matter. Flight travel for example is not that necessary and produce so much carbon into the atmosphere for something that doesn't need to be done and can be replaced with video conferencing. A refreshing film that took the aspects of everyday life seriously and realistically gave suggestions to reduce your carbon footprint.

After watching the film Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, I found it very different than films we had watched before. In the film “Before the Flood,” the protagonist simply visits different countries and probes into the issues of climate change; while in this film, the protagonist is actually a climate scientist who dedicates himself to saving the environment. I found it interesting that he has adapted to a new lifestyle little by little. It has demonstrated a practical way to all the audiences. With his documentary, we all knew that saving our planet is not impossible. All we have to do is switch to a new lifestyle slowly. To add on, we found out that changing our personal behavior will not only benefit the environment; it also helps us to live a much content and meaningful life when we are no longer tempted to purchasing stuff. Although we might not be able to work as hard as Kalmus does, we can all make a difference.

I was also surprised by how drastically different “Being the Change” was in comparison to the previous environmental films we watched that a greater emphasis on the scientific argument and proofs for the reality of climate change or reality of it while this film mostly revolved around the personally-changed lifestyle as a result of his desire to combat climate change. His lifestyle definitely seems different than the typical mainstream American lifestyle that is reflected in today’s society; however, I was inspired by the communities’ emphasis on the greater good for the people around by doing things like group meditation, growing food together, and eating meals together.
 <br><br>

 All behind these great actions were the individuals’ desire to protect our environment and reduce their climate footprint. While the film demonstrates these individuals taken actions as a result of their awareness of global carbon emissions, it only demonstrates a small minority and provokes the question “How many others are willing to take the same action?” 
 <br><br>

In addition, the amount of waste produced by restaurants and houses is immense as shown by how one of the people in the films went dumpster diving and showed all the wasted good food. The major parts of the film reflected these individuals’ actions taken to become a more environmentally-aware group that at the same time focused on giving back to their community. They physically show that it is very possible to reduce one’s climate footprint and if all people take action. Kalmus’ family is no different than any other loving family and his decision to not have a third child and limit himself to two children reflects another suggestion to limit carbon emissions.
<br><hr>
Well said! Contrary to what people who lean towards conservative ways may think, changing your lifestyle to make less of an impact of the environment doesn't have to be a drastic, overnight process. This documentary showed this really well - we just have to be willing to take small steps to adjust our lifestyle until we reach an acceptable point where we are not as wasteful or as negatively impactful as we were before. In a way, it was refreshing to see how personal this documentary felt as opposed to how science-based and factual other documentaries we've watched felt.

This film gave great insight into achievable personal actions one could attempt. It was cool to watch a normal, relatable person go through the days of their lives while simultaneously focusing on bettering the environment and their personal wellbeing. I found it especially relatable having been an intern at JPL the summer after my first year at UCSB. 
 <br><br>
I personally did not focus on any climate or Earth focused work at JPL, and neither do many of JPL’s employees including the employee who made a cameo in the film, but there is a great amount of climate research and general climate awareness across the campus. I along with many others at JPL biked to work; many would simply come in on their bikes in the morning from nearby Altadena and Pasadena. There was limited parking available on campus, so biking was a favorable mode of transportation.
 <br><br>
My favorite part of the film was Peter’s car. Though Maeby is not a car any given person can create, it shows how far a little creativity and ingenuity can go. Peter didn’t need to buy the latest model of an electric car, but just fixed up a car to use waste oil that would have been thrown out. Maeby’s emissions also come from recently processed atmospheric CO2 rather than carbon from underground. 
 <br><br>
I appreciate Peter’s courage to pursue this passion and his strong beliefs, which entailed abandoning other passions like his postdoc program. I don’t know many who would give up working on gravitational waves at Caltech to compost human manure.

First off, I find that so cool that you interned at JPL.  I completely agree with your comment in the fact that the film was a great representation of actual steps that can be made that impacts our environment.  By just making attainable changes to their car and lifestyle habits, they were able to decrease their greenhouse gas emissions by 10%.  That amazes me because if everyone were to make that effort, it would compound to create a movement that could curb the exponential increase of change in our climate.  Personally, even just going to UCSB has decreased my individual emissions, considering how my bike has replaced driving.  That in combination with communal living has actually been some of the most enjoyable aspects of college life, which is interesting since it also has created better habits in me as well.  I hope to use some of the tips presented to keep living my life in a similar way.
  <br><br>
I also really liked Peter’s car.  Even though it breaks down relatively often, it is actually a very successful project.  Inspirations such as these are necessary to instill that same joy and creativity to solve pressing issues … even if they are small changes, it makes a big difference in the long run.  Using less water and energy in day to day life, such as flushing the toilet, eating a plant based diet, and composting waste are examples of that. Something that does bother me about my living situation right now is the use of the dining commons.  I feel like because of the all you can eat system, there is so much waste that accrues unnecessarily.

The global climate is complex, and any long-term solution will require profound changes in the way we produce energy. At the same time, there are some daily actions that can reduce your personal impact on global warming, and these are things you can do. Sustainable solutions that can prevent serious damage to the planet require fundamental changes in the global energy system: the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, and drastic reductions in driving vehicles that rely on internal combustion engines.
 <br><br>
Promoting public policies that support clean energy development and efficient travel are probably the most beneficial actions you can take for the climate and the environment. But cultural and behavioral changes are also part of the overall solution. It's best to start now.

I actually found this film to be enjoyable and a lot more realistic about the changes that humans can do individually. It provided me with a sense of peace knowing that other people were feeling as overwhelmed as I feel daily as I think about the state of the planet and the path that humankind is currently on. I see Peter Kalmus, who reduced his carbon footprint to 1/10th of an average America, made me think that it was possible for many people, including myself, to do the same. He explains how he bikes to work or uses a car that isn't reliant on gas or diesel, which I think is amazing. I think one of the things that he discusses involving produce is important to note. He and a friend give away produce for free that they grow to their community. A lot of movements are now relying on community support and organization, which I think is important when it comes to topics such as climate change which can be distressing for many people. It is important to surround yourself with people who also want to create change and provide a supporting environment as you continue to do that as well. 
 <br><br>
Seeing someone who has a larger grasp and understanding of the climate crisis as a climate scientist makes him a much more reliable source for enacting change. I enjoyed watching this film because it dealt with the changes that we could start doing right now, including looking at the way that food is wasted. The act of dumpster diving in this film was used to show how much food was going to waste instead of being given back to the community.

While most global warming documentaries make you feel hopeless and depressed about the future, being the change can inspire people. He is different from those alarmist and terrible documentaries. These documentaries always show us some painful pictures, such as animal death, glacier melting and industrial emissions, so as to warn and shock us. Although we may be shocked in the short term, it turns out that we will forget these pictures before long. This documentary is not the same. It let us learn a lot of tools and life tips from the Kalmus family, and reduce carbon emissions in a wide range of areas of life. Although green life sounds terrible to most people, Peter tells us that green can actually make life happier and more complete. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a positive impact on the environment and create a brighter tomorrow.

I really enjoyed the film "Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution", especially since it did through the lens of a person who genuinely changed their own personal way of living in order for the betterment of not only their living style, but the environment as well. Peter Kalmus, the atmospheric scientist, was a perfect subject for the movie as he completely unveils the normal ways of living of the average middle class american, and in doing so his methods not only can be successfully applied to lower class, but higher classes as well because it’s not only eco-friendly, but gravely economically efficient, which breaks the chains of socio-economic availability, making it possible for everyone to follow in these procedures. The movie portrays his alternative ways of overall lifestyle, beginning with his own food consumption and his own little backyard garden, the way he traveled and created this vegetable fuel-powered vehicle in order to not relate new emissions but reutilize old oils thus preventing new emissions, his increase in usage of bikes and less airplane usage, and much more. It was outstandingly interesting to see his journey on reducing his carbon footprint (1/10 of his original carbon output). One of the things of this film. thats poet to m was the fact that he not only spoke about the thins we could do, but he implemented them into his life and he showed us how he was completely content with his own minimalistic life while still doing the best he could do. The film really grasped me emotionally because he realize how much we have fucked up the world, as well as how determined he was to create this change, not for himself or for any selfish reason, but for the future of his kids. That true sense of worry and urgency helped fuel him and his journey of change. 
 <br><br>
I believe we should all begin to make major changes like Peter Kalmus did, and I'm very optimistic as to this being the beginning of a critical movement, but I just think that we are all way too comfortable and even ignorant, we don't have a personal drive or a personal push to change which is why we don't do so. As Peter's friend from Caltech, Dr. Allen Weinstein said we don't have the same amount of courage as Peter does to get up and change what we are doing with out loves to go out and make the world the world a better place. We shouldn't just want this because it's a dire necessity to our ongoing existence, but because we want it from the bottom of our Hearts, because only then will we be able to continue with a sense of fulfillment and completion within ourselves.

I feel like this approach is what people need to see in order to make the change themselves. A lot of the lifestyle changes needed in order to save our planet are also, coincidentally, often very good for your physical health as well. Even if they aren't directly related to your health, making changes like reducing your amount of air travel or cutting down on retail spending have positive impacts on the planet and takes money out of the pockets of demoralizing corporations. "Being the Change" is a great name for this film because we all need to take the same action Peter did, even if it's one small change at a time. He realized he was adding to the growing destruction of our planet and decided to make alterations in his life to combat that, and continues to do so to this day. It is inspiring to know that there are still people like him that care about what's happening, not only making the necessary changes in their own lives, but devoting time to encourage other people to do the same. Even if you're already convinced you're doing the most you can, educating people and trying to spread the movement is something we can all continuously work towards. You're right, many people today don't feel the same drive as Peter or you and I do. That is why it's all the more important that we continue evoking change from ourselves and the people in our lives. If we all keep talking and raising awareness to this issue, we will be able to combat the growing dangers of the climate crisis.

The documentary is interesting because it shows how people who seem to have success in our culture through money and material things sometimes completely change their lives and choose to help out the community and the environment instead of chasing material things or the American Dream. It seems that these people realize that life is more than about buying this and instead is more about giving back and helping others. Watching the documentary I wanted to visit La Casa de Paz and meet the people there who seem truly happy. It is curious that Peter has chosen to live with less and yet his life seems very fulfilled. He shared that his sustainable life is very affordable but showed his friend who has spent money on his house to be sustainable he said when he started in 1970 he could afford many of the things he has gotten over the years which is interesting. 


 <br><br>

Personally I have felt that it can sometimes be hopeless to try and stop climate change and pollution because of the huge businesses that are making profit from polluting. Someone in the documentary shared a message about how people are getting climate disorders or have negative feelings about climate change. I was assured by Peter that no one is alone in the fight to stop climate change and that individual action is just as good as collective change. 


 <br><br>

After watching Ken’s video and the documentary I do believe that we can easily make a change in our lifestyle so that we can cut to 1/10 or even less of our emissions. As we saw from the documentary, simple changes can add up to so much which will not only be great for the planet but will leave us fulfilled and happy with our choices.

The film Being the Change spoke a really large message to the public that there are ways to live your life while being environmentally friendly with our actions. Once we know that our everyday actions impact the planet in either a negative or positive way, we choose to either continue or change the way we live. The film heavily highlighted that change begins at a personal level which is absolutely right. If we cannot recognize that our impacts contribute to a large portion of the problem, we cannot fix them and we definitely cannot influence others around us to make changes to their own lifestyles. I thought that it was really amazing when he said that if you’re a musician, then the best way to say it is to show that you can play. In that same sense, if you’re an environmentalist, you say it by showing what you personally do as an individual for the better interest of the planet. 
 <br><br>
As more of the public becomes aware of the implications human actions have played a role in the degradation of the environment and its drastic changes in climate, I hope that it does create a change in human lifestyle. In today’s younger society, I believe more change is possible as issues are being discussed more rather than disregarded or not talked about. Our younger generations are paying more attention to the way the government works and how policies impact not just the local region but also a larger global scale. Personally, as part of the younger generation, a movement to change how we live our lives in how we impact the earth sounds like a great idea and something completely possible as the effects of climate change continue to affect us more.

I think that Peter’s film was very inspirational to those who want to actually make a change in their own lifestyle. Many people don’t have the money to make radical changes and I think this film is for them. Peter has money but doesn’t use it to buy the most expensive tesla or have a modern apartment. He understands that money doesn’t buy happiness so he finds it on his own. Not only was this a good environmental film, but it also has a lot of good life advice. He is able to show us how he lives and how he is content and extremely happy. His film is great for those who know they want to make a change in their life but don’t know how to approach it. In regards to Ken’s question, I think this could spark a climate revolution. I don’t think this film is very well known, but if it was publicized more, it would really influence others. We have to make a change in our own lives before we can expect the government to make a change for our country.

I also found this film inspirational and encouraging. It made me think of the kind of life I could live in the future and how I and anyone else can still make a difference in the climate crisis even if we don't have a lot of time and money to put into it. Kalmus shows us that you can be truly happy and content with your life even if you make changes that may initially seem daunting. As you said, I believe this film could easily spark a climate revolution because Kalmus makes an environmentally sustainable life seem so accessible. It's just a matter of spreading awareness and educating people around us. I also found your last sentence as a really good point—we need to take action if we want our government to.

The film has some similarities with the film "Minimalism". It's interested to watch it as if it reminded me about the experience of watching the first film, though I knew very few about what exactly I should do to make changes when watching minimalism. Then this time when watching "Being the Change", I realized I have been already starting to take actions. I am happy to see that It just reflects how much I actually learned from the course and put on practices, despite that I remember I have been feeling helpless most of the time throughout the course. I truly felt what was spoken in another earlier film "Cowspiracy": I can taste true happiness when I actually devote myself working on something I think it's meaningful and right(don't remember exactly the sentence and who said it). Honestly what I have done is nowhere close to the "devoted myself" level, but I just felt I truly accomplished something, and I plan to keep up and even do more as I can in the future.

I also thought about the similarities that Peter's lifestyle had with the film minimalism. They are introduced the issue of climate crisis and do something rather than just feeling bad about it. They know there is an issue and acknowledge it by doing something about it and changing their whole lifestyle. They moved to a whole new different state to be closer to nature and so it would be easier for them to live this environment friendly life. I would have thought that they would've moved to a small town but yet they chose the city. It makes me think if they did it simply because it would be easier for them to live their environment friendly life with their car running on vegetable oil or because they want to influence and set an example of their lifestyle.

<br><hr>
I think they wanted to make an example of how to live sustainably to their children, neighbors, and friends. Living in a city makes it a lot easier to do so (LA not new york). I really liked his buddy in Berkeley and how he is making changes on the community level, one step at a time. His other friend who was the dumpster guy is pretty interesting too and makes us think about how we can hangs our food system. This film did have a lot of similarities with Minimalism but I liked it better. Pretty fact based and touched on a wide range of subjects..

To be honest, this week’s film confused me. I felt like the way the film was created made it unclear at times what the film was actually about. I think the random graphics of space and compelation of family home videos distracted from the main message of the film. The overall message of the film was good, but I felt like the execution of the film was lacking.
 <br><br>

The film had good intentions of teaching the audience of how Peter Kalmas and his family were able to reduce their emissions to one tenth of the average American’s. However, I did not find the film particularly motivating. I had no drive to all of a sudden start using vegetable oil instead of gasoline in my car. On the other hand, after watching the Minimalism film, I had an urge to declutter things around my dorm that were unnecessary.
 <br><br>

The most important thing I took away from this film was that emitting less makes people happier. I totally believe it. There comes a point in life where more materialistic items do not bring you more joy. Carbon is not the key to living a happy life, in fact, it is the opposite. With less stuff in your life, you are able to live a purer life without meaningless inanimate objects in the way.

I also agree with you. This week’s film “Being the Change” did not move me to try and become more carbon neutral or friendly. I also found a bunch of the graphics and music distracting from the message. I would call myself an environmentalist and I was actually turned off by this film. I found the messages confusing, not only were there suggestions you could do to make your carbon footprint less there were also suggestions about how to change your lifestyle. There was a whole segment on meditation which I did not find necessary to the point of the film. 

 <br><br>

Also, I see how Peter was doing his best to live a “normal” suburban life and also have low emissions. Driving a car powered by excess vegetable oil is something not everyone could do. Yes this was cool, but it is not a world wide sustainable solution. We need to invest in renewable energy and public transportation. I like how they included the rich friend with the Leed house, and how Peter said  “not everyone can afford this.” This shows me how at the time the technology wasn’t available to everyone, but now renewables are being subsidized and are also cost competitive with fossil fuels. This gives me hope for the future.


<br><Hr>
I have loved every single film from this class, up until this one. It was so hard to find ‘negative’ comments to reply to because everyone seems to be raving about how interesting and inspiring Being the Change is. I found this week’s film to be extremely boring, which was very disappointing because I look forward to watching the films Ken assigns. I liked the beginning, and unlike you mentioned I do think a personal story is a good way to go about it and maybe it's only because I love babies but I liked the home video nostalgia. This film is very positive and has great messages, but terrible executions. It was just very slow and poorly produced, and I have to say it turned me off. It was difficult to concentrate because of the pace and Peter’s monotonous voice. 
 <br><br>

Some points were intriguing, like using vegetable oil to drive a car which is very innovative. Or the dumpster diver who mentioned how there's enough food produced for 2x the US population and yet 50 million Americans are food insecure. I just think the movie was little too ‘hippie’ for me, and this is coming from someone who tries very hard to make life changes to reduce my carbon footprint. The film itself was just all over the place and simply boring.




<br><hr>

Having also watched “Being the Change,” I was confused by this week’s film as well. Compared to all the other films we have watched, this one definitely fell flat for me. Sure, the message he was trying to deliver was nice, and definitely important, but the way it was presented was completely off. Instead of motivating me to make changes to my lifestyle, I ended up being genuinely confused as to why this film was even made. What purpose did watching this film serve? It failed to evoke any sort of emotion from me. Honestly, this film was pretty boring and I found myself zoning out the entire time. The way the film was structured made it appear as if this was just a bunch of home videos slapped together along with some random music choices to make a “documentary.” There was little to no production and effort put into making it look nice and coherent for viewers of the film.
 <br><br>


I do appreciate how he tried to show us how it isn’t that hard to reduce our carbon emissions. It was interesting to see how he was able to power his vehicle using vegetable oil instead of gasoline. Before this film, I didn’t think it was possible to do something like that. By using videos from his own life, it makes it seem more possible to make these changes and still live a happy, fulfilling life like he does. However, the film was poorly executed and lacked the wow factor to keep me interested in it. I wish the film was presented in a different way because he does have important information to share with viewers like us, he just lacks the way to deliver it in an engaging way.

I enjoyed this week’s film “Be the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution,” is really enlightening. It really makes you think about your lifestyle and daily choices, this documentary forces you to come face to face with your impact on the environment. The movie follows the life of a man with a family of four, and how he has taken it upon himself to cut back his family’s waste and carbon footprint by making some easy, but also a few extreme changes. He grows his own food, took on biking everywhere, and installed solar panels to his home. On top of this he made a grease powered car, which I find fascinating. He and his family can drive across the country with a footprint of zero because their car runs on vegetable oil. Another thing they have is humanure, which is a toilet that uses your fecal matter to grow fruits and vegetables. Many, including myself, may find this gross and appalling, but in reality it is really cool and a smart idea. We have been taught that we use toilets with water to get rid of our waste, but this teaches us that water is something we can waste, and that is far from the truth. Clean water is becoming more and more scarce, and we need to stop wasting tons of it daily, which is why these toilets are an excellent alternative (if you’re willing to keep up with it). I think the people we saw in this movie are living inspiring lives and make me want to take a few tips from when I eventually own a home. I felt like this film covered a lot of issues we face today. Although, instead of just telling us about the problems and how they will destroy our planet, it actually taught us ways we can improve ourselves and gave us alternative solutions to our problems.

I want to apologize first before I start replying to your comment. I accidentally hit the dislike button instead of the reply button. If you get any weird notification, please ignore it as I've taken it back... Anyway, I also find the documentary enlightening in a way that makes it bittersweet and relatable. Here we're watching a normal, but super smart, guy living his life and doing things that help reduce his climate footprint. It shows not only what he can do for himself but also for his family and that makes it that much more persuasive seeing someone who finds joy in doing so. The "easy" ones that I find reasonable for anyone are gardening and biking. The "extreme" ones that I find difficult for a normal family to accomplish are building his so-called humanure composting outdoor bathroom and driving a vehicle that runs partially on diesel and partially on vegetable oil and knowing exactly when to switch, that's something that should be left for astrophysicists like him and his meditation friend in SF. I enjoyed his visit to the other guy who decked out his home with renewable energy because he had the resources to do so. I like how he said to start small. I think that's a great piece of advice because maybe not every family can afford to install solar panels and replace a solar heating system. But putting the effort in makes it that much more meaningful in some way. Even though the humanure composting system might not work for everyone, I appreciate the guy who invented it and going to Nicaragua to transform the local personal hygiene there. I've been on two mission trips in Panama. Having these outdoor sanitary toilets are a dream! Many parts of the world still live in rural communities where there's no electricity or running water. We should be so appreciative of what we have and not waste the water and food of course. Having that experience traveling aboard and witnessing these living conditions first hand made me so grateful of the life I have here in the US. Perhaps this is where I find my satisfaction in knowing that I understand what I have and not taking everything for granted anymore.

I really enjoyed the film "Being the Change" because not only did it give ways of changing your diet but it also included ways to better your life overall. One of the things Peter recommended or suggested was to begin meditating everyday. I personally would have had a hard time believing that meditation would benefit me if I hadn't done it before because it seemed pointless. But as someone who has been frequently meditating and trying to make it a habit I can now say that it truly does offer a multitude of benefits, since meditating, I now have improved moods and sleep better overall. I would recommend that at the very least everyone try meditating once a day for a month and seeing how it benefits them. I think that it might surprise you what you find out!

This film was very inspiring to myself as well with the changes that Peter has made to help his environmental footprint, along with his wife jumping on board of his movement and ways of living. The main point that I was enticed and intrigued by was the idea of meditation and the power of that. Being a religious man, prayer is some way is relative too this idea, but meditation I also feel can be a positive way of relaxation and realization for the life around me as a whole. I do agree that this has a multitude of benefits for one’s life overall. I am also motivated by Peter’s aspiration to changing the environment with his grease oil powered vehicle along with his next to zero airline traveling. His happy life with his wife gives positive appeals to emotion in regards to persuading the viewer to live like such. This model of actually “being the change’ is quite inspiring and makes any viewers realize they can actually make a change substantially with small daily changes to our lives.

No one has gone into depth about how to do our part like Peter Kalmus does. Peter tells us what he has changed in his life to cut his fossil fuels to one tenth of the average American usage. By sharing his story from the beginning-he watched Al Gore's fight against global warming film were all he suggested was to change a light bulb, obviously not enough, sending Peter to a path of exploring for the right solution- it allows the viewer to connect with Peter and to trust his advice. Peter said: "by changing ourselves, we send a message with how we live." Stating that the process of changing our lives begins with our heads, hands, and heart. Head means realizing intellectually that there is a problem by looking at the science. Hands means taking action, such as gardening, changing light bulbs. Heart kind of ties it all together. Once we begin taking action, we feel in our hearts a satisfying feeling knowing you've done your part. I found his comment really interesting because he is right, if we really cared about the climate crisis, we would take action beginning with ourselves and everyday lives. The film then takes us on a journey to different places of people doing their part as a community, such as casa de Paz, repair case, citizens climate change lobby, and others. By introducing us to the organizations that people are forming, not only brings hope to the viewers but also inspiration.

This film is interesting and different from other films. The filmmaker did not use some data or prediction of scientists to warn the public that the planet is in danger, but rather he used his own experience and his action as an example to the viewers to appeal to us to do our small part in order to protect the earth. I respect Peter’s idea and action. He changed his lifestyle and his family’s. He is telling the public that everyone should do their own parts to protect the earth. Although I think his idea is amazing and I agree with this idea that everyone should protect the earth through some small things that they can do. However, I think some of the actions in the film are hard to apply to a large population. For example, to use vegetarian oil to replace fossil fuel is not acceptable to many people. Since this technology is not mature, many people might worry about the potential danger to this technology. And it is hard for many people to give up their loved cars and buy a “vegetarian” car instead. Also, to give up the plane is not acceptable for many people. Plane has been an amazing technology since 20 century, because of its invention, humans are able to go to the place in a great distance in a short period. It brought so much convenience to humans. It is so hard to give up. And if we give up this transportation. The world and the countries on this planet will lose connection, and the development of economy will stop. Although I think some of the ideas in this movie are impossible to apply to reality, I think this movie is a great movie that reminds people what we can do and what we should do in person to protect the earth. I would recommend it to my friends.

The Documentary Being the Change was way more positive then any other documentaries  we have seen so far. Usually most of the other documentaries shows horrifying images that made me feel very bad and scared. But After watching this documentary, I got a significantly better vibe towards the end. I felt that we can all do something to change the earth from what it is today. I realized that I do not need all of these new clothes and technology to be happy. What also surprised me was trying to run my car through vegetable oil. I could not believe that Kalmus just went to different restaurants and was able to upgrade his car in order to run on vegetable oil. Lastly, it is very interesting that they mention meditation in this documentary. I thought that did nothing with Climate change but then I start to realize something. People do these activities towards climate change in order for themselves to be happy. Maybe meditation helps a person to become one with nature and understand how important our world is. I am also going through meditation and it does make me think how much the world offers us. All in all, This documentary makes me inspire even more to pursue my motive of making me and other people happy by doing great things for the world.

your comment discussed some of the themes and ideas of the film that I found to be most important and valuable. Yebisu writes that “Being the Change” is much more positive than the other documentaries we have watched. I picked up on this from the beginning and it was very refreshing that this film carried a positive growth mindset throughout. Yebisu also talks about his surprise when meditation was brought up during the film. I think that this captures another main idea that is shown throughout the film. As the film studies the lives of these people that have cut their emissions ten-fold, I noticed a general trend among these people. As they change their lifestyles, they seem to become more spiritual, more simple-minded, more peaceful, more community-oriented, kinder, and happier. Analogously, the Repair Cafe that is shown in the film brings the community together and makes the people involved happier. It is very notable and telling that as people decrease consumerism in their lives to try to reduce their emissions, they become happier and better people, as well.

I found the ways Peter was able to cut down his emissions in the film "Being the Change" interesting. He was able to reduce it by a shocking amount and has done so by ways I would have never thought of such as using a car powered by grease. It was also nice to see and hear about all the other people he has connections with and see how they have the same values. It was also really nice to see just how much all of them support each other.

The vegetable oil powered car really was amazing. It reminded me of an idea a child would have in order to reduce carbon footprint as it is really thinking outside the box. Just knowing that peter made that possible is truly astonishing and admirable. The lengths he goes through to create such a car makes me think that no idea is too crazy when our planet is at stake. And maybe its ideas like this one that seem pretty crazy and outside the box that will make the difference. Also, i completely agree with you that the support he receives from various people really goes a long way and is such a beautiful thing to see.

Peter went form 20 tons of CO2 to 2 tons which is a very drastic change of lifestyle, I noticed one thing that he was genuinely happy while lowering his CO2 emissions. He started to wonder how the future of his kids were going to be and that is where he started to get worried and do something about it. I am glad that he did something about it rather than just complain about it. I realized that he had a lot more time for example to work on his car and grow his own food. After watching the film, it made me feel that there was hoped to save the planet, if Peter and his family can significantly lower their carbon footprint than we all can. I like how the film showed Peter’s daily life how he was able to have two kids, a car, and grow some of his own foods. This film was genuinely heartwarming I enjoyed everything about it Peter’s friend who operates Casa De Paz is someone that enjoys giving back to the community and in doing so they are helping with climate change. More people should do what he does and give back to the community as much ad one can.

Just as Ken said in the video, making these life changes towards a more environmentally friendly society does not have to involve hardships. I think this concept is very important and is one that I hadn’t really thought about before. When the family followed in the film mentioned how they walk their children to school every day, which saves unnecessary CO2 from being emitted, they also included how this daily ritual allows them all to have more family bonding time, along with healthy exercise and quality time outdoors. This film illustrates how acting in various environmentally friendly ways and enjoying life are not mutually exclusive; doing the former is likely to be fulfilling and cause the latter. I think this concept has been lost in translation nowadays and needs to be reiterated, as people only view climate solutions as taking away and limiting resources, luxuries, and desires. If we change our perspectives on these solutions and seek happiness through fulfillment rather than through material wealth, we can both enjoy life more and save our dying planet.

 I found the idea of climate disorders quite intriguing and shocking, as this shows that the worsening of the climate and the hopelessness of fixing it is truly causing panic, one that even impedes on mental stability. The crisis is not purely environmental. It is not even just political, or societal. The climate issue is an all-encompassing problem, reaching every and all aspects of life. We will not be happy, we cannot live comfortably until this is resolved.

Despite the production quality, Being the Change and Peter Kalmus's eco-friendly lifestyle really piqued my interest. I commend his realization that he wasn't living by his own values and beliefs at one point in his life and changed for the better. A lot of his lifestyle changes, as you said, did not come with difficulties; in fact, he and his family reaped multiple benefits, particularly healthwise by growing their own fruits and vegetables, walking their children to school, and appreciating nature, to name a few. His sense of fulfillment and passion, shown in scenes like when he switches his modded Mercedes from diesel to WVO, was really fascinating to watch; it shows how much he truly cares and believes in what he practices in his life now. Meditating for 2 hours a day outside also clearly showed Kalmus's commitment to his personal growth as he focuses on maintaining his mental health. Like you pointed out, these daily habits provide a means for achieving both happiness and a healthy planet that material possessions simply cannot in the long term.

To answer Ken's question, I'm less certain that the actions of Peter and his friends are enough to snowball into a large climate movement, but I am hopeful that his humble presentation of both his own life and the lives of his good friends, lives that prioritize sustainability, practicality, and generosity, motivates many viewers to do what they can to save our planet. Personally, I feel more inspired to live sustainably having watched how easy and fun Peter and his family make it seem.

The film Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution was much different than the other films. Rather than the protagonist just speaking of the issues that we are doing that cause climate change, he is actually making a change. Peter Kalmus saw a problem and realized that he had the power to make a change, even if it was slight. When he had his children, he knew that they deserved a world that was environmentally safe to live in. Future generations deserve a planet given to them that is better than when we have received it.
<br><br>
It was interesting to really see gradual changes in his lifestyle with implementing meditation, plant growth, and changing his car to run on grease. This really shows that one change can lead to more changes. From changing his lifestyle his personal carbon footprint as Ken noted, is 1/10 pf the average American. His carbon footprint is 2 metric tons which are the range that all Americans should be shooting for. Not only are his changes impacting the environment positively, but they also positively change his mood. Meditation allows us to be able to drawback and feel the world by realizing we shouldn’t get lost in the nonsense of the world. Biking is better for the planet and it also makes a person relieve stress by getting in exercise. Peter doesn't mention using alternative technological methods as electric cars because biking is much more sustainable and beneficial for the environment. 
<br><br>


The people Peter Kalmus associates himself with are happier with their lives by living minimally and helping others even claiming that the secret of happiness is being to service for others. I thought it was interesting when Ken pointed out that the road of happiness seen by the modern world is based on the road of a high carbon footprint. Having the best car, clothes, or the largest home is what people expect to make them happy. When in reality, these materialistic items are only detrimental to the environment and ourselves. Peter Kalmus represents the true meaning of someone who is willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. Personally, I couldn’t make as many sacrifices as Kalmus; however, this does inspire me to make some small changes in my life because any change is worth doing.

 I too believe that I could not give up nearly as much as Kalmus has since he became the father of his two boys, but I do feel inspired after watching this documentary as I know that there are some changes that I can make in my life right now if I wanted to. Watching this film I recognized a few aspects of Peter's life that I too had planned on doing once I graduated college and started living on in the real world. Growing my own food and raising my own chickens has been something on my mind for years as I grew up gardening fruits and vegetables with my family and have always wanted a chicken to lay fresh eggs and provide that small amount of protein. I personally do not think that I could convert my car to run off of vegetable oil nor would I be able to go through the work it takes to collect, process, fill up the car, and keep said car running as sad as that may seem. I wish that I would be able to follow the lifestyle that Peter and his family are living to a T, but sadly there are a few things that, even as an activist for saving the planet, I too think would be hard to give up. I personally do not think I could 100% give up flying, nor do I think I could give up driving, but I do my best to spend long periods of time between my flights and to not drive as much as I can, using my bike as a main form of transportation. 
<br><br>

Watching this film I was amazed at how genuinely happy the Kalmus family is, not just Peter, but his wife and kids as well. His wife was able to give up the average American lifestyle as a means to better her husband and better the planet like sacrificing her sanity with the oil car. Like Ken mentioned, most people have been raised by the consumer culture, not happy with what they have and always striving to have what's new, better, and improved. Watching how genuinely happy this family was made me realize that items do not necessarily make people happy, having a good life with the ones you love, doing what you love makes you happy. After watching this film I think I may take up meditating after watching how passionately Peter and fellow friends talked of meditation and how it affected their lives. I strive not only to better this world but to be genuinely happy with myself, within myself, and within this world. Knowing that I actions I do to help the planet is only one drop in a bucket of water I still do not get discouraged as I know that every individual who lives as I and Peter do are adding to that bucket of water as well making a difference in the world whether its one bucket at a time or not.

I agree with you on the fact that this was not like any of the other films we watched. We physically saw him make the changes and implement them into his daily life rather than just spewing facts or meeting with people who oppose the climate crisis. It was really inspiring to see that the things Ken says actually work, and even though I knew it did, it made it even better after seeing how easy it was to make these changes. He knew he had the privilege and the opportunity to change his life after being a father, and he not only helped save the planet, but became happier. This showed someone like me (who never eats vegetables, shops everyday, etc.) that there are changes I can make that don't require entire lifestyle changes. He decided to do this for the future of his kids. It was also interesting to see how he actually became the change he wanted to see in the world. We didn't relearn redundant information we already knew like other climate movies– we saw it in action and how much it can change the planet. It's like a domino effect. One small change leads to another, then to another, and suddenly you've changed your life for the better of yourself and the planet. These small changes, that included things like meditating or planting his own food, are easy changes that can diminish your carbon footprint by so much. Who knew it could be this easy?
<br><br>
A quote that stood out to me from the film in particular was when his friend said, "We are constantly throwing things away. But where is away?" I immediately had to pause the movie and think about this. We are literally a floating ball in space- where does everything actually go? It was such a small statement that held so much impact. Everything we do, everything we own, and everything we make stays on this planet forever. There is nowhere else it could go. Why are we messing up our only chance at life? Compared to the other films, I think this one had the most impact on me. Like Ken said, our society is fueled through consumerism and our road to happiness is made of carbon. We really need to take a step back and look at what we have done before it is too late.

Aside from Peter Kalmus's quirkiness, it was interesting in hearing about his life and how he lives it.  It was also wild to learn that Kalmus gave up the amenities that come from having a very comfortable income and instead became a minimalist, intentionally limiting the benefits he could reap from being a middle class American. While his life is a testament to his will power and devotion to environmental activism, I still feel that personal action isn't nearly as effective as other methods of environmental activism, such as protest or political action. Unless you can feel the effects of personal action in your own community, it simply won't be enough to make a difference, and focusing on it detracts from effective ways to combat the climate crisis. A counter point to this though, is that Kalmus is a climate activist, and uses his personal action choices as a conversation starter and as to build his credibility as a climatologist. As he explained in his speech in Engl 22, his no fly policy was much more important for him to follow, than one of us in the class, because we don't the same voice and recognizability he has in the climate activist world, and he must prove that he really is about the cause. I think that the film was an interesting watch, but it didn't motivate me to make any changes to my own lifestyle, or educate me much more than what I already know.

I completely agree with you. I think that personal lifestyle changes definitely do have an impact on emissions. However, I think they have far less of an impact than actions such as (and especially) political activism. With his knowledge as a climatologist, I feel as though Kalmus could've gone even deeper with his message. It felt like this film was a great platform for educating viewers on the climate crisis, however its focus was directly oriented at personal actions. With his knowledge, it feels as if Kalmus could've used this as an opportunity to insert information about other types actions, especially political. He could have made his way of living into a political statement. Perhaps spoken at rallies or marches; explained how political and personal action go hand in hand. Seeing his way of living was inspiring, but it is also something that many people simply cannot do. As much as many of us would love to, we cannot devote all of our time to a 100% minimalistic, eco-friendly way of life. But something every citizen can do, is take political action. This again comes full circle to my main concern, that this film just did not dive in deep enough. Political action is something tangible; something free.
<br><br>

Not to say that this film did not have a lot of valuable information in it, because it did. The way in which Kalmus put our understanding of growth into perspective really threw me for loop: "I’ve noticed that my brain extrapolates growth by assuming trends will follow a straight line over time. For most processes, this is a good short-term approximation. But if this is true of most human brains, and I think it is, it explains why exponential growth takes us by surprise: it sneaks up on us by seeming linear at first. Then it explodes." This statement just hits so close to home. People really do not understand how fast the climate crisis is now occurring, and this explains exactly why. I just found that incredibly interesting because no other films or readings discussed this concept. 
<br><br>

I also do respect Kalmus's devotion to his lifestyle. I definitely felt that some his changes were ones in which I could implement into my life after seeing how easy it was for him. I think this little spark of hope for change is still important, even if this film may not lead any actual change.

Watching this film, I assumed Peter was going to be just another person who spewed out facts about climate change, without showing any real lifestyle changes he was willing to make. However, I was immediately proven wrong, and I am in awe of the changes Peter and his family made in order to reduce their carbon emissions. I appreciate that Peter is a climate scientist, so that deniers cannot claim he has a limited scope of understanding, because in reality he is one of the best equipped people to educate the general public. It made me hopeful to see that people can live sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyles, especially in a suburban family setting. I think people are typically wary of lifestyle changes because they worry it will uproot every aspect of their life, but that is simply not the case. Two changes that I found particularly clever were the construction of a car that runs on vegetable oil (known as Maeby) and the humanure system. These lifestyle changes provide a sustainable twist, on modern-day staples. Peter showed that life in the modern day can still be sustainable, and I hope that the groundwork he provided will inspire others to follow.

I totally agree with what you said about "Being the Change". I felt really engaged towards the fact that Peter was very relatable. He talked about his balance between living his old way of life while living this new environmentally friendly life as well. He talked about wanting 3 kids but settling for 2 because of our unsustainable growth in population. He was definitely someone who struggles through change but is willing to do it for the better of the planet. This is much more relatable than just seeing someone live this perfectly eco friendly life that for many of us are too hard to get too no matter how much we want to change. Peter shows that you can have a balance in life while still saving the planet. Referring to the car running on vegetable oil, I thought that was so amazing. It's always been a question of mine on why we don't attempt to discover new ways to power cars. Peter found one way by using old vegetable oil from restaurants to run his car. If adopted by all drivers on the road, this can greatly reduce our emissions and the amount of fracking needed for oil. Although we should definitely try to avoid cars in the future, for those that simply cannot live without their car this is a great alternative that a little can go a long way. I definitely found myself learning a lot more from this film simply because I feel like these small changes are a great and interesting way to implement environmentally friendly ways into our lifestyle without having to give up everything we love in our culture today.

I think this film is good for all the people that have the privilege of higher ed, white passing appearance, and resources. I think that this film is pretty linear and tunnel visioned as it only focused on limiting one family/person's carbon footprint instead of realizing the intersectionality of all issues as well as the root of all problems. Why do we have the struggles we do now? How do we confront these issues? How do we remove mal-intentional people that are currently in power. I think this is a good film for people that are middle class, have the option of choices, that are not faced with climate disaster threats constantly, and are having a comfy life. But it isn't for those that are at the frontline of the climate crisis. As we move forward in this movement, we can't leave anyone behind. We can't just say "oh well, they were poor anyway" and then leave them behind as u proceed to reduce your carbon footprint and not speak on these issues that are essential to this environmental movement.

This documentary discusses how to improve the global climate in many different and perspectives, some of which are new to me. The first possible solution is to minimize scales of farms. There are many disadvantages with mass scale of farming. First of all, it uses machines like trackers to replace manual labor to minimize the cost, which depletes the land and its fertility by heavy use of fertilizers, oils, and pesticides. Moreover, in order for machines to harvest and operate on the land, the efficiency of space is low. However, within small scale of farming, people can use their hands to take care of crops. Thus, there is no need for pesticides and stuff, which can increase the fertility of land over time. In addition, people can practice intercropping such that multiple times of crops can be grown in the same piece of land compared to machines. 
<br><br>

 Another prominent method to diminish the climate change is to use renewable energy, including biomass, geothermal, wind, solar energy, rather than burning fossil fuels. Though the investments could be incredibly high at the beginning, it would turn out to save much money over a period of time since generating such energy requires almost zero input except for the purchase of installation and technology. On the other hand, enhancing the trash collection system would minimize the amount of waste and makes it possible to produce things from the waste such that new productions can be sustainable. 
<br><br>

 From the angle of economy, this film gives us two feasible ways. The first one is to establish sustainable factories as the paper factory mentioned in the film. Though it produces envelopes out of woods, its employees promise to plant four trees for cutting down every single one. Also, the factory uses rainwater to clean up machines to reduce its water consumption. On top of the factory, there are plants which can absorb carbon dioxide. On the other hand, local currencies are promoted as well as a nationwide uniform currency. One advantage is that local currencies can be created without loans such that people would no be put into debts. 
<br><br>

 Democracy can also play a role in fighting against climate change. However, democracy in many nations are just limited in elections. The future of democracy should lie on new ways of representation of the public will. One specific example is a small town in India that allows every citizen can participate in major decisions in planning of future development. This allows the most urgent problems to be solved prior to other relatively less important things. Moreover, democracy has to do with the education. In Finland, every class of 15 students has two teachers who have received a 5-year degree in education. Moreover, teachers would walk around the classroom to ensure that every student would be taken good care of rather than standing in front of the class regardless of those who can not follow up with the class content. In addition, discussion allowed while solving problems. The believe that every student is learning, except that some of them learns faster, while others learns slower.

I think Tomorrow is a good movie to watch. Although it is a movie about the environment, it shows us a lot of beautiful shots and music. This movie still talks about our future problems in our environment. However, this movie is more optimistic about these changes. It also describes many examples of solutions in agriculture, energy-saving, and government policies. So, it is effective at communicating its subject. Like the previous week’s film, it introduces these changes first and solutions. In this film, I could see how people behave when they try to save this world. One example is the trash disposal system in San Francisco. It transforms these trash into fertilizer and then redistributed to local farmers. Unlike the traditional way of burning trash, this method is more economical and sustainable for our environment. Based on the above, I think the audience for this film is mainly for those who care about this problem since they can get a lot of useful data and new perspectives from this documentary. By using much relaxing music and beautiful shots, this documentary seems more like a movie. It shows there are hope and reason to continue to strive for progress and change.

In the film "being the change", Peter is worried about the future because of the climate crisis, and he believes that the earth will be uninhabitable if people do not take action and make effort to mitigate it.  Therefore, there are lots of changes that Peter made to solve the issue. For example, he uses grease oil to replace fossil fuel to run a car, which produces zero CO2. Furthermore, he advocates that meditation is quite helpful to release stress, and it can effectively prevent people from giving out negative emotions. Also, he notes that people should fly less. Because only a few people choose to not take a plane can not prevent CO2 from emitted to the atmosphere, we need to make more people to make the change. Moreover, people should not through the food which looks not good because of bruised or bumped.  40% of the food in the US is wasted. However, this waste can be avoided, and there are lots of ways to deal with the waste, but most of the waste in the US is sent to landfill. The waste sent to landfill will produce methane during the decomposition, and it will take 25 years to truly decompose the waste. Hence, people can follow the ways highlighted in the Documentary, “Wasted”；for instance, they can use the waste to feed people, like uses the wasted bread to make beer. The next step is to feed animals, and the third step is to generate renewable energy, and then is to make compost. Finally, the waste is sent to landfill. Peter proposes to use the waste to produce compost as well. 
   <br><br>
  In my perspective, people can not solve the problem if they do not be aware of it. Also, it is not enough to just be aware of the climate crisis, acting upon the knowledge is also important to reverse the climate crisis. Peter took action and made efforts to reduce his CO2 footprint by employing his understanding about the climate crisis, and he tried to motivate others to take action. Thus, it is necessary to understand the climate crisis and act upon the knowledge to deal with it.

You mentioned that 40% of the food in the U.S. is wasted- I found this to be one of the most frustrating parts of the film. Like you said, this waste can be avoided and dealt with in ways that are environmentally friendly, such as through the humanure compost system. In addition, America produces enough food to feed twice the amount of our current population. In spite of this massive overproduction, there are still millions of people starving every year. Directing the discarded food to people in need could be extremely beneficial to not only the underprivileged, but also the environment. This is just one example of how efforts to mitigate the climate crisis have more than one positive effect. Peter introduces several ways that people can not only better the environment, but their own lives as well. I think the compost system that you brought up could be super impactful, and more people should consider using it.

Peter Kalmus is a wonderful example of doing what you can with what you have to live in a way that best serves the planet. His simple three aspects to personal climate action are the head (intellectual understanding), the hands (actually doing stuff), and the heart (where you find meaning). Although Kalmus’ actions like driving a vegetable oil-fueled car may seem extreme to some of us, I think it’s about doing the best you can which will be different for everyone. He notes that he still has a large emissions rate compared to someone in Bangladesh, but again, he’s doing the best he can while living a modern life which I think is why he serves as an inspiration for many of us living in this day and age where advancement is all we strive for. He shows us that it’s possible to live a normal day to day life while being environmentally conscious. Kalmus makes living this way look appealing and fulfilling. The film talks about intrinsic motivation and how acting on your moral values produces much more happiness and meaning in life. It’s important to make this point known in the film because for some people, changing their lifestyles for the sake of sustainability alone frankly isn’t enough. There needs to be some personal gain or incentive which in this case is just a better quality of life and happiness because you’re living in a way that is rooted in the best intention.

I am happy to find someone who also appreciated how Peter Kalmus approached the issue of the climate crisis. Instead of shoving hard facts or statistics down the audience's throat, Peter Kalmus shows the audience his day to day life and the actions he takes to mitigate carbon emissions. This gentle approach shows us some of the ways that we can do to fulfill our parts in improving the climate crisis we are in right now. Similar to how you felt, when learning that Kalmus drives a vegetable oil-fueled car, I almost started laughing because of how flat-out ridiculous that sounded. However, I soon realized how ingenious utilizing vegetable oil as fuel is, as the vehicle is essentially only recycling carbon dioxide that is already present in our atmosphere. Like you said, not everyone will be as extreme as Kalmus as to switching to such an avant-garde way of filling up their cars, but as long as everyone makes even a little effort, the climate crisis can easily be improved upon.

The documentary Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution was different from the documentaries of the first five weeks, since the narrator Peter Kalmus didn’t interview a lot of people or list many scaring numbers and statistics about the bad impacts of climate change. Instead, he focused more on his and his families’ personal lives and his own way to change the situation of climate change by doing little things, like using less harmful fossil fuels, or  raising less children than nowadays. I strongly felt that Peter Kalmus was dedicated to reduce his own carbon emissions, and was using this documentary to let us know how to make some changes of climate change by doing little things around us. This documentary was mostly about how one man — Peter Kalmus and his family live their life in a perfect Eco friendly way. However, some of his methods seemed unrealistic and was not easily accessible. For instance, his vegetable oil-powered car, it was expensive and couldn’t be accessed conveniently. Also, Peter explained the reason why it was called “MAYBE”, since he didn’t even know whether they maybe can arrive at the place with this car, so it was quite a waste of resources because its unusefulness. So, I am a little disagree with these kinds of lifestyle: using many resources, but producing inefficiently. Moreover, reducing the times to take flights maybe unachievable, since many people study abroad and many people would go on for business trips very often.
   <br><br>
Even though, I am not convinced by these some environment-friendly tips, we can easily tell that Peter Kalmus was actually making us to acknowledge that making just a small change can still make changes to the society. And, he seemed hopeful that if many of us change our living styles and our efforts were gathered together, then, our earth will be much better and our little movements can lead to a huge improvements of the impacts of climate change.

Your comment makes very valid points that I agree with on many parts of it. After watching, ”Being the Change,” the documentary made an emphasis on the individual changes that come with combating the climate crisis. I personally prefer documentaries that are more goal oriented to inspire and help viewers understand what is going on rather than scaring them into understanding. Peter Karmus and his family living in an eco-friendly lifestyle was great to see how it is done on a daily basis. The purpose of this document was not so much for people to make a full flip on their lifestyle, but to rather find a few things if they can in their lives to change that would over time benefit the climate. To see that even he knows it is efficient to make changes in his life to be more eco-friendly, like that of his vegetable powered car, gives a realistic view on the climate crisis. To live in our modern era, we can maintain a healthy balance of waste, as do all animals and beings on Earth. To do this though, we do need strict guidelines that will help us still stay below a certain level. This is not a permanent solution, and when the technology and mindsets are right, we can truly move towards a zero emission society. Overall, seeing the family live a happy life helps me want to tell the story of how we can deal with the climate crisis.

I have seen both movies before, but I really wanted to rewatch Being the Change. I really like how Kalmus talked about depression, a lot of the times we forget that realizing the issue can be really disheartening to the point where we become frozen in fear. When he said "I mourned the planet...and I mourned my son's future," I think he perfectly summed up what we all go through at one point in our journey to becoming an environmentalist. But, we have to realize that we still have a chance to save this world we love and to save future generations. The movie talked about personal actions so many of the things we have learned have been repeated, but the concept of humanor compost really stuck out to me. At first glance, it sounds gross or ridiculous, but how cool is it that we can actually use our waste for something? This can also be used for a backyard garden or just to reduce water consumption. I also like how Kalmus doesn't only talk about taking personal action but also relates it to a more spiritual side to environmentalism that we rarely see. I had never thought of combining meditation and environmentalism together before I had seen this film, but it really doe smake sense. There is something so peaceful about being closer to nature and in a way, a protector of it. Another thing I loved about the film was the emphasis on community. La Casa de Paz and the Repair Cafe encompasses exactly the kind of thing we need in order to progress this movement. We need to come together as a community and help each other, if we can make a loud enough voice then it will be enough to inspire the government to actually make the necessary changes.

I too loved how Peter Kalmus brought up his stint with depression feeling helpless when staring at the adversity of climate change because like you said we all go through a similar feeling when searching for a way to fix it all. What I thought was most important about him sharing this was how he never gave up and it was the gradual changes that he began to make, which helped him see the impact he can have and the changes that'll follow because of it. I feel too many people push aside the thought of taking personal action because they think being 1 out of 7 billion people will have little to no impact and while this may be somewhat true, our actions create change reactions from those close to us. While composting or wasting less doesn't have a large direct impact on a personal level it makes others acknowledge what you're doing and question their practices, which allows for the spreading of change. Just like the guy that created the humanor composting said, people "didn't know that it was possible" to turn our waste into something so beneficial, and they wouldn't have learned if the creator was disheartened that his impact wasn't going to be large enough from a personal level. I feel this movie really hit home that little changes actually lead to the greatest impact and while changes are needed on a large scale its a lot more difficult to convey this if the masses don't care. This is why I loved the Repair Cafe movement and La Casa de Paz because both are able to impact plenty of people in a positive way while demonstrating happiness is obtainable through an environmental lifestyle. So it is essential that people keep making these personal changes because they can help educate others on changes they can make too and will lead to more and more individuals caring about the impact we humans have hopefully leading to large societal changes. Like they said in the movie you don't just climb Mount. Everest, you have to climb to the base camp first and get acclimated before you can conquer it all.

The movie Tomorrowdescribes how to protect the environment from the five perspectives of agricultural, energy, economic, political and education, we should pay attention to the small things around us and the future of the earth on which we live. So, I think the first thing we need to do is to avoid waste and not over consume what the resources we have now. One thing surprised me is that in fact the big companies do not produce the food for us to eat, only those little farms produce the food for us to buy and eat. That is very impressive for me. As long as we can cut the rate of the farmland used for big companies, we can protect the environment by not putting the pesticide into the soil that easily. I never think about that farming can save the soil before, which I learn from the movies. Although some parts in movie are kind of profound theories, I could tell all the movements are trying to save the earth from the worse condition. Even lots of scientists said that the climate change was unstoppable and it was no way to completely change the environment to the original condition, but from what I learn from this movie, if we take the action and begin to protect the earth as one big community in tomorrow, we can save the earth just from tomorrow.

This week’s film “Be the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution” gives me a special perspective on personal behaviors toward climate change. The film depicts the life of a man who decides to reduce his impact on the environment for his children. In the film, we see how he changes his behaviors step by step, along with his family. They grow food by themselves, take on biking when going outside, and make a grease powered car which allows them to leave zero footprint of carbon dioxide. Inspired by him, I think it is also necessary for me to take actions. In the film, he tries to eliminate negative emotions to others and prevent himself from feeling desperate about the world through medication. I think it is a good way to relax our body and refresh our mind, so I would like to try medication in my daily life. Also, I would take actions to reduce my footprint on the environment and protect our earth from global warming.

Instead of seeing the human being on earth or from same region as a whole, this new documentary approaches the serious subject of climate change from individual perspectives. What individuals can do, what we can change to save the world.
   <br><br>
It's true that the earth cannot be saved even if everyone starts to change every light bulb in their household right now, we need some action more effective, maybe started with consciousness of what we are wasting and what we can use less. I like that peaceful house idea in particularly because at last we have to be a people person since we have to count on each other when there is no where we can go. Be respectful, and cherish whatever we have now is one of the most important idea people today should possess.
   <br><br>
Using vegetable oil, plant your own vegetable to eat, plow the ground and use purely eco-friendly toilet, maybe these are hard to achieve as a college student, but we can start from wasting less food. Grab the exact number of dishes you want to have and be able to have every time. 
   <br><br>
whatever we do, we must start acting right way, and maybe do it in a sprit of dance, graceful, and with a smile.

Hello,  yeah this film takes a less alarmist approach and allows the audience to take a look into an environmentalist's day to day life habits and social groups. Peter Kalmus is a climate scientist who has instilled fundamental sustainability habits into his family's life such as driving a car that runs on vegetable oil, biking to work and harvesting his own garden. The main objective of the film is to showcase the little habits one can adapt to leave smaller carbon footprints. Individual efforts by climate scientists and environmentalists can inspire normal people like us to stop wasting food, driving a car or buying so many things. I think this film is particularly important because Peter decided to not have a third child for the sake of the environment. This goes to show we have to make changes in our life that we sometimes do not want to make.

Yeah, I definitely agree with you here. Peter is not just a random person, but he is a climate scientist who abandoned his engineering dream to become a climate scientist for Caltech. For someone that successful, you would think that he would just become materialistic (engineer and all), but the documentary shows that he's not. He is, in fact, living a very simple life using very little stuff. He doesn't focus on solar panels and the only techy thing that he has is his car that runs on vegetable oil instead of gasoline. He lives a relatively normal life and uses his talent to help out others instead of himself. To him, that's the key to happiness and I think we should all try to learn from that. It is truly an inspiring story about a relatively successful man stepping down of this throne in order to help the planet, and he's happier, his family is happier, and it is all good. We really should be more like him. So yeah, we all really should reduce our footprints as much as possible to save the earth, and maybe then we will be happier, too.

The film being the change is trying to convey a message: reducing our footprint can be started from every single family. The family in the film has done their best to reduce their impacts to the environment. Clearly, they have a better lifestyle. However, there are more families who do not accept this lifestyle. It is really hard to correct everyone's opinion. As Ken mentioned before, many people who born at his age believe they have rights to enjoy what they have created. We cannot force them to transfer lifestyles because that seems not "democracy". Families who have already changed their lifestyles can focus more education about climate crisis for their children. Young  generations can definitely have more clear understandings about their lifestyles and how do their lifestyles relate to the environment. 
   <br><br>
In the film, some actions about reducing footprints are a little bit extreme. For instance, traveling by bikes. Although this is great for protecting the environment, you lose much more about convenience and happiness. Most of people won't accept such moving. I think doing some simple changes are enough. You can actually change a lot simply by reducing the consume of meat.

In watching the film "Being the change" it was important for me to remind myself who is the target audience of this film. I could argue that may of the lifestyle choices proposed in this film are 1. not appealing to me, & 2. not viable for some people. But the fact of the matter is that this film was intended to attract people who are invested in the climate change movement and whom have a firm belief in individual activism. I personally don't believe that individual activism, at the scale that this film shows, is not very efficient, but i do support its approach to providing an alternative for those who are looking to be involved. If this film was intended to persuade a conservative, I frankly don't believe it achieved its purpose. This film also exposed me to a different perspective, albeit negative, I think that it helped me understand older generation's view on climate activists. In the attempt to promote an eco friendly lifestyle and present themselves in a positive aura, the film carried a desperate tone to call for attention. This is the lighting in which the media sometimes casts climate change activists in. Maybe it was the spirituality and the mentioning of a "House of peace" in the film that threw me off. In any case, I do support the people who choose to live out this lifestyle. As obscure as it may seem, it does achieve it purpose of reducing one's carbon footprint.

I think that this week’s film aimed to show us how personal behavioral changes can play a large role in the fight against climate change. The family being followed in this film is shown to live a very sustainable but totally fulfilling life; yet, they emit only 10% of what the average American emits. This goes to show that many of the items and values that we hold to be of great importance in life are actually not a necessity, especially when it comes to happiness and self-fulfillment. Happiness cannot be bought; it must stem from interpersonal connections, caring relationships, and personal self-worth and fulfillment.  
    <br><br>

While it may seem like personal changes are useless to this issue in the grand scheme of things, we have to realize that if everyone thought this, and just decided to make no changes to their habits, then absolutely no change would occur. However, if everyone made a small change, or a lot of people made a larger change (such as switching to a plant-based diet), then the collective change will actually be significant and will create a difference. Personal change also influences those close to us, perhaps pushing them toward making similar changes to their own lives. This effect will continue to spread, faster and more easily as more people join in.
    <br><br>

I really enjoyed how at the end of the film, I could piece together the previous sections into one greater meaning, which lies within Buddhist theories and philosophy. I admittedly was a little confused in the beginning of the film, where there was a lot of focus on meditation. While I do believe meditation can help guide individuals toward their true self and their meaning in life, I didn’t initially understand how this could have anything to do with the fight against climate change. But, by the end of the film, I thought about everything that was discussed and I was able to realize the significance of each of our decisions and actions in life.

It's both astonishing and encouraging to see a successful climate scientist doing the most to reduce his climate footprint. As someone who is very knowledgeable about the dire effects that increasing CO2 emissions has on the planet, Dr. Peter Kalmus is using such knowledge and translating it into action that is not only doing good for the earth, but also inspiring others to follow his example through his actions. His lifestyle is something of a culture shock to me as utilizing vegetable oil as car fuel and having an outdoor restroom seems rather radical as it may be to most. However, it's the result of the "Head, Hand, and Heart" model that is as effective as it is simple. Kalmus does and says what he can using the knowledge he has as a scientist because of the value and meaning he places on creating a better environment for his family and people in general. While many, myself included, may not be able to radically change their lifestyle as much as Dr. Kalmus, watching this documentary made me realize how important it is to start taking small steps towards changing not only our actions and behaviors, but also our attitude and perspective towards how and why our individual actions matter.

I don’t know if it was just me or what, but I didn’t find this documentary to be that good. Don’t get me wrong I liked learning about this man’s life transition into decreasing his carbon footprint, but I just didn’t like the production of the film itself, the background noise of certain clips weren’t the best and some shots kind of irritated me. But that’s not what’s important here, I just wanted to express my opinion on that considering we’ve talked about methods of spreading information and I don’t think this one does it quite well. Most of the information presented in the film we’ve learned about in previous lectures, for instance the percentage of food wasted, and the harm of a car to the environment. I found it very cool how he made his car run on used vegetable oil even if his wife didn’t have much faith in it. I loved that she named the car Maeby, very clever. The one thing I didn’t quite understand was the bathroom situation… if someone could shed some light on that, it’d be great.

Seeing that there are people out there in America with a carbon emissions that are about 1/10 of the average American goes to show that there are people out there who really do want to better the earth and keep the earth hospitable. For me personally, this serves as motivation to see what I can do for the earth and how much I can reduce my own emissions. When Ken mentions the Paris Agreement and that Kalmus is meeting that standard with his 1/10 emissions, it really puts into perspective how much the average American emits. We need to do something in order to reduce our footprint similarly to Kalmus and still be able to live a happy life. As someone who lives in a suburban area, it goes to show that there are things that I can do to reduce my carbon emissions. I can guarantee that my emissions are so much more than Kalmus and that  there are so many simple things that I could be doing to reduce my footprint. Some of these simple things could be growing my own food or using more of public transportation instead of private. To relate it back to previous lectures, taking the train or the bus is something that can really cut our carbon emissions and this can lead into the slow travel movement. We need to think about not what we want as Americans but what we need as humans. We need to stop taking things for granted such as the earth and begin the change that we need in order to save the earth that we live on. Without change, there can be no better future and we might just spiral into destruction. Learning about Kalmus shows me that one person can do something in the world and can have an impact on the world whether it be big or small.

When I first started watching this film I felt a little disconnected to it, but I am glad I continued with it because it showed me that attaining a climate-conscious lifestyle can be real and you can still live happily. I do agree with you that seeing Peter Kalmus and his family made me feel hopeful because yes there are people in the United States who are knowledgeable and are trying to show the rest of the United States that we can drastically lower our carbon emissions and still live a happy normal life. I was also shocked that he said his emissions are 1/10 that of the average American. It just goes to show that if our cities and states and even our federal government just implemented legislation then as a whole country we can dramatically lower our carbon emissions and then I feel we could have an actual shot at saving our planet for future generations and also help to save the many endangered species being affected by the climate crisis. I have said this many times and so has professor Hiltner, but we really need grassroots effects to implement change in this county. We have the biggest economy and we can influence other countries to follow our lead, but first, we have to be that change. We have to walk the walk not just talk the talk, even though many politicians right now do not even want to talk about the climate crisis. Some big things that we can start with are changing the country's public transportation, and supporting locally grown organic food. One big that can affect our carbon footprint is eating beef or food that is not made in our region and it has to be flown in from far away. If we take these steps as individuals as well as a country then I believe we can make the progress to implement bigger things like a carbon tax and switching our economy away from fossil fuels. Once I finished the film I felt inspired by Peter Kalmus, his family, and their journey into becoming better citizens by living a climate-conscious life.

I think the documentary was effective at communicating its idea that individuals should devote efforts to improving climate crisis. The narrator, Peter Kalmus, introduced his family initially and claimed his own idea of climate change. He concerned that the massive production, growing population, and huge waste on the planet are majors reasons for climate change. The narrator used his daily life to show how an individual can contribute to improve the environment and save natural resource. In this documentary, Peter used veggie oil instead of fossil fuels and one of his friends grow vegetables by himself and send them to neighbors. Besides, Peter designed a special bathroom that can save more water and create fertilizers. All his efforts is to save resources, showing that individuals’ efforts can improve the crisis of climate change and advocating more people to take actions. I think the audience of the documentary should be everyone on the planet and most people have already realize the problem and miserable consequence of climate change. However, people still buy massive products that exceed their actual needs and discard useful resources in their everyday lives. My general reaction towards the film is that individuals’s efforts towards climate change is influential and necessary. The accumulation of tiny efforts may finally lead to huge improvement on our resources and environment. This documentary gave me a sense of optimistic since the advantages of saving energy and resources is oblivious and it gave me a strong motivation to take action. The narrator also made the idea and concerns of climate changes easy to understand. After watching the documentary, I am willing to recommend it to my friends since people should realize that any tiny efforts will be influential and necessary in climate change.

Being the Change is truly an inspiring film. It not only shows how to reduce your climate impact, but that it is 100% possible. Peter had to get a little creative when it came to the car and other things around the house, but if we could have infrastructure so that people did not have to create vegetable oil cars, I think this would really work. I kind of feel like Peter is living the life that Ken has lectured us to live for the entire quarter. Like this film had everything. From denouncing fossil fuels, to promoting minimalism, it was extremely comprehensive. I also think they had a very good point. What is the american dream now, being rich, having it all after starting from nothing. But in the end, what does that really get us. Look at the rich and famous, do they have meaningful marriages, kids that they actually raised, friends that they can joke and have fun with consistently? It really doesn't seem like it. Now, look at Peter he seemed happy the entire time, he may have been putting up a facade, but I believe him. Living a meaningful life is much better than being rich, and in the process we can save the planet.

Nobody can do it on their own, and everybody can do it on their own. Peter, on behalf of himself, takes himself and his whole family to a new philosophy and a new lifestyle of 1/10 carbon footprints of average Americans. He believes if there is someone working as him in every community all around the world, the world will for sure gradually getting better. For his family, he raises two kids with his wife, and their daily transportation is almost on foot or by bike. They save food resources by never throwing food to dumpsters. One of his friends shares the same philosophy as he does. He, on himself, explores a lot of dumpsters in the United States, and he brought a lot of food out of dumpsters to show people how much food people have wasted. Actually, food production in the U.S. can feed over twice American populations, but there are still tons of people dying of starvation. People get hurt because of food waste and the earth gets hurt as well. The kind of lifestyle Peter picks really inspires me to try on this lifestyle as well, and I really want someone in my community to lead this movement to make more people know that we can make a little bit change to save ourselves and our following generations. The thing really is that if each one of us could take a little step, we as we whole can make a big change.

“Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution” does not only revolve around the different actions people could integrate into their lives to save our planet but how making these changes can make life more meaningful and happier. I enjoyed how the film touched upon initiatives we already knew and expanded upon that. For example, one of the things we discussed during class is having less stuff and refraining from consumerism culture. The documentary discusses a repair cafe, which helps people create less waste, and it brought together a community of repairers and those who need things fixed. 
    <br><br>
As the course progressed, I have become practically convinced to start using my thermos/metal straw more avidly, eating less beef, and more. Now, after watching this film, I am even more motivated to do more. Now, I think I wasn’t doing enough. Maybe not something so crazy like having a car fueled by wasted vegetable oil or dumpster dive for food, but perhaps, I would take on meditation and being more conscious of food waste. It was really interesting learning about the Food Waste Fiasco and how much perfectly edible food is wasted!

I agree, this film gave an insight into the life of someone who is actually making the changes we are learning about. It was eye opening to see how normal this family’s life seemed. They did make drastic changes, but they still go about their daily lives. This film made making some of these choices seem easier. I always thought going vegan (I think I would be more inclined to become climatarian) would be some huge drastic lifestyle change. However, if this family can drive a vegetable oil powered car around every day, then maybe I can eat less meat. We’ve heard about Ken’s life and the way his family lives, but actually being able to see a climate conscious lifestyle in action makes a difference. I think this family sets an example for many suburban families, that living consciously can be done.


<br><hr>
I'd have to agree that the film Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution," has really begun to put into perspective some of the feelings I've had as a result of lifestyle changes. From consuming less meat to my modes of transportation, I've began to make note about how I feel as a result. I enjoyed within the documentary how Peter addressed this approach and the result of lifestyle changes. Most notably the tie into mediation and the impact that has held on him. Recently, I've begun to practice this when I feel stressed or simply to refocus my energies. As expressed by Peter, this has seemed to hold beneficial effects in his efforts to drastically reduce his carbon footprint annually, while dismissing the idea that American's materialistic mindset. I also agree that while I may not be ready to necessarily ready to convert to dumpster diving per-say or collect oil to run my car, but after watching this documentary, I feel that I can definitely see the long term positive effects of decreasing my carbon consumption.

<br><hr>
As you mentioned that as this course has progressed you have slowly become more conscious of what’s wasted and what’s not. I too have come to be much more aware of all the food I intake and simply all the appliances that I use in one given day. I think what truly stuck out to me the most about this film was that he focused a lot on not only the individual doing what they could to support the environment, but he talked about communities of people who came together because they shared the same love to collectively work at repairing what generations and generations have broken. I think a lot of times it’s overwhelming to think that it’s up to us and therefore we put a ton of pressure on ourselves to be better and go to the extreme right away. I’m not saying this pressure is bad as it’s needed to do what’s needed to ultimately better our planet, but I think that the way how he approached it from a community's standpoint attracted me more. The idea that there are more people taking on this issue relieves the worry of it only being me fighting the climate crisis head on.

I think this is a great film. Peter Kalmus told the world that even though we live with less fossil fuel products, we still can have a good quality, enjoyable, and natural life. There is no doubt that Fossil fuel products are really necessary for our daily living. But we definitely can use much less than the amount we are using right now. I think the film effective tells its audience its subject. As everyone knows that fossil fuel products are one of the major causes of climate change and pollution of our environment. People refuse to use less fossil fuel products because they worried this decreases their quality of life, but this film teaches people living with less fossil fuel products, people can still have a good and enjoyable life. I think this film perfectly communicates its subject-using less fossil fuel products. Besides this, I like and respect Peter so much, I can't believe he can do that like he grows food his own food to eat. I can't believe someone will do that nowadays. Also, he gives a great connection to his children that we need to protect our environment.
    <br><br>
After I watched this film, I start to think about what can I do for the environment? I came out that I can start to use fewer vehicles, use more public transportation.

People who depend on fossil fuels experience a different type of life. I think it depends on the individual whether or not it's necessarily better. Our government and culture endorse fossil fuels to the point where it's used in almost everything we do. I also respect Peter for growing his own food. Unfortunately, nowadays I'm feeling very pessimistic. Can our culture actually change? I also enjoyed the film and plan on showing it to my friends. There's a great beauty in simplicity that not enough people have been exposed to yet.


<br><Hr>
I also thought "Being the Change" was a good film in the way that Kalmus told the audience that even though we live in a world based on fossil fuel products, we can still maintain a good quality of life. I agree that fossil fuels are necessary for our daily life for now, because our economy is dependent and so many aspects of our life, but I also believe that we can transition from it in the future. The film does do a good job of explaining that we can use much fewer amounts of fossil fuels than we do now, and how living with fewer products base don fossil fuels doesn't decrease our quality of life in any way, and we can still live a good and enjoyable life.

The Being the Change documentary was filmed in Pasadena, which is where I am from, so I found an extra interest in it. However, it made me question why all of these movements were going on so close to me without me knowing it at all. Lots of the points made in the film seemed really powerful, and they debunked multiple common misconceptions. The idea that one person cannot make a difference is common, but untrue… “One person that avoids flying means one less seat but 300 people that avoid flying means one less plane.” Those are 300 individual people so you cannot say that an individual doesn’t matter because there is power in numbers. You cannot have a big group and start a movement without individuals. Another big issue is the growing population, which many say should be solved by not having kids or only having one. However my favorite part of the film is when he said that if you do want to have kids, just raise them to be change makers. He has very clever ways to answer common climate change issues, which not only made the documentary interesting, but will make the difference in the real world. 
    <br><br>

It was crazy to me hearing that Americans “produce enough to feed 2 entire American populations when 50 million Americans are food insecure.” The concept of dumpster diving of course sounds unappealing, but knowing how much perfectly good food is thrown there makes it sound much more sane. 40% of food is wasted and many of that comes from extras from restaurants and grocery stores where it may not look appealing although it is just as much quality. It is a shame that the standards of many are so high that food is being pointlessly wasted while millions are starving. The film brought up the good point that food cannot be thrown away, it has to go somewhere, and unfortunately that means into the atmosphere in the form of methane. 
    <br><br>

If we listen to the film, and act with our head, hands, and heart I believe that we can make a huge change for the future of climate change. Our heads will help us understand, our hands will help us act, and our hearts will help us inspire.

I also thought the most shocking portion of the film was when Kalmus mentioned the fact about the gross amount of food waste accumulated solely in the US. It is a sad realization of grocery store policy and "expiration dates". I agree that most consumers would not purchase items that are nearing or past their expiration date, however, it does not mean the food needs to rot in a dumpster. We could be donating this food and helping those who are in need and starving! It is frightening to see what lengths certain corporations will go to just so that profits are not squandered.
    <br><br>

My brother graduated from the University of Vermont a few years back, where he found a passion for the environment. He used to tell me of stories of how he used to dumpster dive at local grocery stores with his housemates. He was never strapped for cash either, but he saw a huge problem with the amount of waste we produce and sought to ease the problem on his own accord. He faced the ethical dilemma of conforming to the standard view of waste and one that utilized the potential of useful waste! What is one man's trash is another treasure. In this case it was anything edible!

<br><hr>

I live a few miles away from Pasadena, so I was also pretty surprised to hear how close to home this small movement was taking place, but I was also really glad to hear that it was happening. I think small communities have the power to bring about big changes, and I really liked that Peter decided to bring about change on a small scale even though he had the resources to go bigger. I also think he is a great example of not forcing other people to do exactly as he does, but instead using his actions to inspire people to follow his lead, as he mentions "If you reduce your emissions, that's good. But [you need to] let the world know you're doing that. If you're an artist, make art about it. If you're a musician, make music about it. If you're a writer, write about it. However you can, get the word out". It also shows the significance of individual action. Moreover, Peter takes everything we may be afraid of changing in our lives and makes it seem not as hard as we expect it to be. There are small steps everyone can take and eventually we can all be comfortable making bigger changes. 
    <br><br>

I also like that despite being a PhD holder and working for NASA, Peter has found more happiness in giving back to the community, like by giving out free fruit to his neighbors. It takes us back to the idea of minimalism, and how satisfaction is not linked with what you material objects you possess.
    <br><br>

Lastly, I like that you mention Peter's head, hands, heart motto. I think that was a nice, short way of reminding everyone what they're capable of.


<br><hr>

I love that you mentioned how your brother was not strapped for cash but still went dumpster diving for environmental reasons. He cared more about the climate crisis than how society views his actions and that is exactly what we need in order to mitigate it. Especially in America, I think that excessive pride is in the way of people solving this crisis. Many people are against riding a bike and taking public transportation out of fear of it being seen as "embarrassing". The same thing goes for eating food that is nearing the expiration date or living in a small house or the majority of solutions to the climate change issue we are facing. We must care more about our planet than our societal status.

To be honest this film was god awful. The points and message were obviously good but the quality and execution were so unbelievable poor that I dont see much use for this movie outside the context of this class because no one in their right mind would watch this without being forced to for a grade. Seeing as one of the major themes this week is how to convince others to act, I think we should add improving mediation of climate change science and activism. Regardless, I really enjoyed how personal this film was. Although Peter is obviously making the case that his way of life is something that we, the audience, should consider as an option, his message is mostly delivered as a personal change that he made for personal reasons. Peter consistently cites his children as his inspiration and motivation. This is significant because it allows peter to elaborate persoanlly and passionately on his lifestyle in a mannor to which almost everyone can relate. Although not everyone has kids, everyone has people that they care about and want the best for. Thus, with each reference to his children Peter instills passion in his audience for the people that THEY love. This is very important because it allows for his message to be sincere, passionate, and relatable without the invasive tone of most climate change activists. Ken also touches on this in his introduction to this film cautioning us to wait for people to come to us for informaiton about climate change and how best to live your life in the face of this collosal issue.

Peter Kalmus’ changes in his lifestyle are examples of how all Americans should be living to mitigate the climate crisis. Instead of driving, he bikes, and when he does drive, it’s with a car that runs on waste vegetable oil. He also grows most of his own food. Ken noted that Kalmus’ emissions are about two metric tons, the value that all people should aim towards. Beyond Kalmus’ own personal achievement, he reveals that anyone can make those changes and live a fulfilled life. One part of the documentary that I particularly liked was the “house of peace,” which focused on serving others rather than the self. There is extreme fulfillment in serving others, which is rooted in my religious beliefs. Serving others can lead to a cascade of events where more and more people also serve. If people had the mentality to not only serve others, but serve the earth, then I can only predict that our climate emissions would plummet. However, I do not think this is a beginning of a movement because so many people are still be out of touch with the reality of climate change. Kalmus made the changes he did because he was well-informed as a climate scientist. In order to create a movement for this lifestyle, more people need to acknowledge the same information that Kalmus has.

Yes, I too see the issue in the education of the public on the climate crisis and related issues.  People don’t really know what to do or what all the effects are of the situation so there is definitely a disconnect between those who are scientists and those who are simply the general public with little to no knowledge on these problems at hand.  This is why education is very important.  Without education, we are not making power out of knowledge because only few have the knowledge and the masses are unaware.  We must educate the public because once they know what the problem is and what exactly we have to do when it comes to combating climate change, then they would be much more receptive to making lifestyle changes that may be harder for them.  With more knowledge, the masses can make more educated decisions and become more conscious of their actions.  This is clear with Peter Kalamus and the lifestyle he and his family made.  Since he is a climate scientist for NASA, he is able to have in-depth knowledge of the climate crisis and what he can do to minimize his impact.  Therefore, I also think that it would be worthwhile to provide more people resources on the climate crisis, in addition to more education, as people could then maybe use certain websites that calculate their impact or the website could make recommendations on what changes they should make specific to their life.  Overall, I think that this could be the beginning of a movement, but in order to ensure this, conditions have to be met such as the increased education of the public.

Peter Kalamus is an inspiration and a role model for people to follow, and he does a great job at showing how the changes that he makes not only benefit the environment but also he and his family’s happiness.  Decreasing the materials and looking to do things or find happiness in worthwhile outlets is what America has to do.  The American Dream must change from our wasteful and materialistic ways that have only made the climate crisis worse.  Now is the time for change, and we must take action before it is too late.

I liked the way you described the portion of the film where they explained the “house of peace”. I agree that serving others can manifest itself into the idea of also serving the earth. Peter Kalmus’ lifestyle is definitely a happier one and it is evident with the personal look into his life at home and out in LA as well. He employs the type of change that we need to see in the world and should serve as motivation that this lifestyle is attainable and could change our lives for the better. It certainly makes his relationship with those around him more meaningful and also with the items he uses everyday. He enjoys growing his own food and putting work into his car to make it run on corn oil to make it a viable option in reducing his carbon footprint if he has to use a car.

Despite this, I don’t think this is the beginning of a movement. People still haven’t wrapped their head around the severity of the climate crisis. They are willing to accept the inevitable doom but aren’t scared or worried enough to actually take action because they think the costs of change outweigh the ultimate demise of the planet. You’re right: people aren’t all scientists like Kalmus was. They don’t understand this issue inside and out like Kalmus does so that was his motivation to change his lifestyle. People need to get passed the thought of it “being too hard” to integrate these changes in their lives. Sure, growing your own food seems like a challenge but at some point in time we couldn’t just go to McDonald’s and have our meal prepared for us so why cant we do it now? It’s because people are selfish and cant get passed this simple barrier.

I agree with you. Though I found this film sweet and inspiring, and it was nice to see how all of these changes made a really positive impact on the life of Pete and his family, I do feel like it's not a fair change to expect of everyone asap, especially because many people who are making a big carbon footprint are doing so because they don't know many ways to reduce it, or aren't being educated on the climate crisis at all. I don't feel like having a scientist and engineer as the main protagonists of the story helped it feel approachable or doable for the average person. For example,  One of his solutions was build an outdoor bathroom and rewire your car so it runs on vegetable oil- that's not something the everyday person can do, so I feel like a lot of people would just tune out after that, and feel like they won't be able to make any massive changes. However, I do feel like Casa de Paz was the perfect way to get people educated and involved in reducing their carbon footprint because it brought a large community together where the members more well versed in climate science could teach and help their neighbors become more conscious and environmentally friendly. While I do appreciate this film and I respect all the changes this family made, I feel like it's not particularly approachable for the average person or someone who hasn't been educated on the climate crisis- i think community-based changes and education are probably going to be the most effective- just like Casa de Paz.

I enjoyed how serene this film was, I agree with Kelsey, Peter Kalmus’ is capable of showing us how Americans should be going about their daily habits. Kalmus lifestyle changes were direct examples as to someone finding out the impact of their actions and changing their habits to better the environment. While I don’t intend on pursuing a lot of the “drastic” changes Kalmus has, for example that of him fueling his car with oil waste, I find it very impressive that he goes to these lengths to counteract actions every other person doesn’t think twice about. I think that what I most liked about the documentary was the overall tone, Kalmus explains that he did not grow up thinking about these issues, instead a middle class man working towards the “American dream” he took a step back to look at the consequences of his actions and that was enough to incite change. This approach genuinely presented the problem as a bit less complex and helps push the idea that anyone is capable of protecting and fighting against climate change via our daily actions. The film helps emphasize once again that our actions are a product of our social structure and culture so doing as Kalmus did, looking at who and what we are affecting when we opt for something, is crucial to addressing the problem. There is really no argument after that, as Kalmus mentions at the beginning of the film, if there is a problem there is also a direct solution and action to help combat it. This is why I also agree with his “head, hands and heart” idea, where we must take intellectual understanding of what we are doing, take action on our beliefs and find meaning through the process.

I was amazed after I learned about how Peter Kalmus is living his life. I was even more amazed when Kalmus' emissions numbers were revealed. It's a remarkable achievement that Kalmus' keeping his emissions extremely low while living a happy and fulfilled life. Kalmus’ example also shows us that it’s not impossible to reduce our personal emissions to such a low level. I think one of the big reasons why more people are not going the route of Kalmus is because they don’t know how easily a lifestyle like this can be done.

I totally agree with you that this film is a beginning of a movement. I think that this film is different from other documentaries because, it shows the point of view form a normal person, which means that a normal person can easily do something to actually help to reduce personal carbon footprint. This can be a guide for those who do not know what to do actually to teach them what can they do in their normal life, so that protect the environment and reduce carbo foot print is not just a slogan for them any more.

 Moreover, I also agree with you on the point that it is important inform the public the real situation of climate crisis, which can be the most important incentive for a person to do something to do something to protect the environment. The reason why Peter can do all these things is that he is an environmentalist that he is really knowledgeable about all these things. If we want more people to take part in this movement established by Peter, we should let all of them realize the true situation.

I like your discussion part on the “house of peace” which brings out the notion of serving others and the world. As suggested by Kalmus in the documentary that serving others create happiness. This reminds me of the lecture last week on how Americans should lend a helping hand to developing regions such as Bangladesh, where survival depends on chance and fortune. Despite such global actions, each individual can also contribute to a better planet by serving others, such as growing food in their own gardens and sharing them with neighbors. Ken also mentions that preoccupation with goods and products won’t necessarily bring us happiness. It’s the process of communication and helping others that fulfill us as human beings. Regarding your concluding statement on why it’s not a beginning for such great movement at present, I realize the significance of education, especially empowering women in many developed and populated regions. They have to have such knowledge in mind, so they can learn how to live a simplistic life with few fossil fuels. Kalmus’s effort as an individual is not enough for the whole planet even though he successfully cut off his carbon footprint to 1/10 of that of an average American. More changes ought to be seen in the world.

I agree with your stance that Peter is an outlier when it comes to lifestyle changes. He seems like a real cerebral guy, and is obviously a deep thinker as evidenced by both his position as a scientist and his devotion to his new lifestyle. Peter represents the way people used to live, but I think that at least here in America, there is no way that people will adopt Peter's lifestyle on a large scale. That being said, I think people can adopt small changes and feel more connected to the Earth as a whole. I think environmental education has a great deal to do with this. If people have exposure to open nature as well as education about ecosystems and biological processes, they can see that nature is a wonderful thing that must be protected. This may not inspire them to take drastic change in their life, but it may cause them to take a step back and evaluate how their life is impacting the environment. If enough people take this step back and live a slightly more simple life, that would be a positive thing for the earth and for society.
